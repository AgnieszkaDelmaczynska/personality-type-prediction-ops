"We will continue double matching ALL donations up to $50,000 from now until December 2nd through this link: https://t.co/2JElTqxQMW

This means TRIPLE the impact for every donation made. 🫶"
So far we’ve raised over 278,600 meals overall through our Giving Tuesday Fundraisers With Feeding America! This is absolutely amazing! 🙌 Let's keep it going!! 👇 https://t.co/kriu6ihUDR
"We’ll double donations made through this fundraiser link: https://t.co/2JElTqxiXo

Join us in our mission to #ENDHUNGER and provide 1 BILLION meals! When we all come together, every donation, big or small, truly makes a difference. ❤️"
This means that for just $10, we’ll be able to provide 300 meals for our brothers and sisters in need, thanks to the double match! 🙌
From now until December 2, we’ll double match donations—providing TRIPLE the impact 3️⃣✖️🥘 —up to a total donation of $50,000. $1 helps provide at least 10 meals secured by Feeding America® on behalf of local member food banks.
Our partners at @FeedingAmerica work tirelessly to provide nutritious food directly to our communities using their network of over 200 food banks and 60,000 food pantries across America. ❤️
It’s heartbreaking to know that it’s often our most vulnerable who are deeply impacted by food insecurity — children, families, and the elderly. But together, we can CREATE a different reality. 🫶
In the United States alone, nearly 34 million people, including 9 million children, are food insecure. With everything going on, food prices are reaching new record highs, making it increasingly harder for families to get nutritious meals.
My friends! I’m excited to invite you all to join us for our FIFTH ANNUAL Giving Tuesday Fundraiser benefiting Feeding America. 🥘❤️👇

For every dollar raised @FeedingAmerica helps provide at least 10 meals through its network of 200-member food banks and 60,000 food pantries and meal programs. Join us today, let's reach 1 Billion meals together!
If you feel called to join us help our brothers and sisters this #HungerActionMonth, please go to https://t.co/uZzNVmpGXx. I WILL CONTINUE TO MATCH YOUR DONATION, dollar for dollar. So, your $1 is actually = 20 meals through my 1 Billion Meals Challenge.
Human beings should not needlessly go hungry. Collectively, as one human family, I believe we must get food to people who need it and help those who do not have the means to secure food for themselves or their families.
Many people facing hunger are forced to choose between food and other basic necessities like shelter. Making those kinds of decisions is already extremely difficult for anyone, let alone when you have children.
In the United States alone, nearly 34 million people, including 9 million children, are food insecure. Access to nutritious meals is growing increasingly difficult with food prices near-record highs.
"Excited to share that 8 years ago, I set a goal to provide ONE BILLION meals by 2025. Today, with your help, we have already provided 919 MILLION meals and are projected to meet our goal of ONE BILLION earlier than expected! ❤️

It all begins with what you CHOOSE to FOCUS ON.
"who we want to be, and how we can serve, and contribute.

Focusing on that highest vision helps create energy and momentum. We can kick feelings of frustration or depression by changing the channel of our attention to how to help someone in need."
Most people focus on how to avoid pain in the short-term. If we want to push our life to the next level and experience fulfillment and true quality of life we need to be laser-focused on our ultimate vision and our sense of mission —
"Where FOCUS goes, energy flows!

Remember, what we FEEL is a result of what we’re choosing to FOCUS on."
There’s no denying that you and I are part of a significant inflection point in human history. Check out my recent conversation with historian and demographer Neil Howe on The Fourth Turning: What past generations can teach us about our future. https://t.co/clW8tylRHe
Our partners at @BeomniRobot are at @Comic_Con -- tag me and let me know if you stop by for a visit! 🤖 https://t.co/4xe4GlSOkY
Where focus goes, energy flows. And where energy flows, whatever you're focusing on grows. In other words, your life is controlled by what you focus on. That's why you need to focus on where you want to go, not on what you fear.
"The three decisions that control your destiny are:

1. Your decisions about what to focus on.
2. Your decisions about what things mean to you.
3. Your decisions about what to do to create the results you desire."
"If you think meditation isn’t for you, this podcast might literally CHANGE your MIND. In today’s world of constant distractions, it’s critical that we develop the ability to direct our focus. Mindfulness &amp; meditation are tools in our tool belt.

.@elonmusk &amp; @WFPchief -- Let's join forces in a strategic mtg privately OR in my studio wired for an interactive town hall with tens of thousands of people around the globe simultaneously sharing ideas in real-time. Let’s solve this together! In deep respect -Tony Robbins
There is more than enough food produced in the world to feed everyone on the planet. Still, as many as 811 million souls worldwide go to bed hungry, including 14 million children. Let’s change that!
So if @elonmusk &amp; @WFPchief are interested, let's bring together the smartest minds &amp; strongest philanthropists we know. Together let’s do the real work required to FIND THE SOLUTION. Ending world hunger is an achievable goal!
Instead of making this @elonmusk's responsibility, let's look at it as all of our responsibility to end world hunger. THE ANSWER IS OUT THERE! But to get it we'll need more than money. We need Elon -- and others' -- mind power, strategy &amp; economic support to get this done!
As someone who personally knows what living with food insecurity is like, these aren't just stats to me. In partnership with @FeedingAmerica I've provided 850 million meals over the last 7 years, on the way to 1 billion meals. But that's far from enough...
I’ve stayed close to the exchange between @elonmusk &amp; @WFPchief on the pressing and immediate need to ALLEVIATE WORLD HUNGER https://t.co/cQkmZGdrmH

Today, we remember and honor the memory of those whose lives and legacies we shall #neverforget. 🇺🇸❤️🗽
We remember that no matter the pain, tragedy, or injustice of a circumstance, the resilience, strength, and light of the human heart and spirit cannot be extinguished.
We remember and continue to be inspired by incredible acts of compassion between total strangers, and the countless volunteers who stepped up from every part of our great country to come to the aid of those in need.
We remember those we lost, and pray a special blessing today for all those who lost their mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, children and loved ones.
We remember heartbreaking stories of goodbye calls made to loved ones that remind us that, ❤️ IN THE END LOVE is TRULY ALL THAT MATTERS.
Nineteen years later on #911 we remember &amp; honor our heroes — pilots, passengers, community members, firefighters, police officers, first responders, our military, rescue animals, &amp; other guardian angels who, with unwavering courage, put their lives on the line to save others. https://t.co/zA5xQX2M7k

In this episode, I go on a journey to uncover the truth about coronavirus with an expert 7-person panel of highly qualified researchers, a veteran epidemiologist, a Nobel Laureate, and M.D.s testing and treating patients on the frontlines.
"Shining examples of the beauty and resilience of the human spirit are evident in the midst of it all.

The challenge is, much of the #COVID19 news frenzy comes to us clouded by the agenda of the business of mass media which builds momentum by selling us a narrative of FEAR."
It’s been more than 2-months since the coronavirus (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic. If you have felt stress, fear, or frustration at any moment of these unprecedented times, you’re certainly not alone. But there’s been good news all along, if we decide to look for it.
This episode reminds us to stand guard at the door of our minds, practice discernment when determining trustworthy sources, and think critically in order to stay flexible and maintain the ability to pivot in light of new information – especially when lives depend on it…

Graduation may look and feel different this year, but what brought you to this proud moment are the universal tried and true power virtues that guide us in any environment and every era — persistence, resilience, resourcefulness, creativity, playfulness, hunger, grit, and grace.
Have faith in your abilities to do anything you congruently commit yourself to. Create a vision for your highest self — what do you want to become a decade from now? If the path doesn’t exist yet, CREATE IT! If you can’t find a way, STEP UP and MAKE a way.
As you navigate these unique times, remember that there are no straight lines in life! It’s a CONSTANT process of learning, improving, &amp; evolving. Stay flexible! The moment we overcome one challenge, I can promise you’ll soon be facing a new one; that’s what GROWTH is all about.

It all begins with what you CHOOSE to FOCUS ON."

“Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation.” #ViktorFrankl
Whether you’ve already read this book, or have not yet had the opportunity, I strongly recommend reading it. 75 years later it’s enduring message is as relevant, powerful, and inspiring as ever.
"This is the essence of his school of #psychology called #LOGOTHERAPY which attests that the DRIVING FORCE of our human existence is MEANING.

We can CHOOSE to view any experience with a higher MEANING and move forward from it with renewed PURPOSE."
Despite the unconscionable pain and suffering he was subject to, Dr. Frankl’s creativity and sense of humor persevered and he deeply believed that although, as humans, we cannot avoid suffering, we can CHOOSE how we respond to it, we can choose our ATTITUDE through it.
EVERYTHING was taken from Dr. Frankl including his parents, his brother, and his wife who was pregnant with their child. Being a Holocaust survivor is an agony and a level of suffering beyond what most of us could ever even comprehend.
This month, April 2020, marks 75 years since Viktor Frankl was liberated from Türkheim when he subsequently wrote the first draft of the historically influential book #MansSearchforMeaning in just nine days.
Dr. Frankl was a Viennese neurologist, psychiatrist, and Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned in multiple concentration camps during WWII, including Auschwitz where an estimated 1.1 Million human beings were senselessly killed.
Viktor Frankl’s book, MAN’S SEARCH FOR MEANING, provides the most compelling and triumphant account I have ever read of humanity’s ability to persevere through the unimaginable.
"The ability to find MEANING in the most difficult times, even in times of injustice or extreme stress is perhaps the most important skill we can develop in life.

Through our #OneBillionMealsChallenge, we’ve already provided over half a billion meals in the last five years to those in need — and we’re well on our way to reaching 1 BILLION MEALS by 2025!
In times of uncertainty it’s often our most vulnerable who suffer from food insecurity — young children and senior citizens.
It’s heartbreaking to know that in the US alone — one of the wealthiest countries in the world — 40 million Americans, including more than 11 million children, do not know where their next meal is coming from.
As we remain steadfast in our mission’s work to serve our brothers and sisters in need, @FeedingAmerica is continuing to implement proven practices of safe food distribution while meeting the unique challenges presented by this crisis.
Our partners at @FeedingAmerica are working hard to assess this unfolding impact on children and are developing strategies to meet the emerging needs of hungry families.
School closings for many families mean the absence of free and reduced-price breakfast and lunch – similar to the loss of meals experienced during summer and holiday breaks – which can impact MILLIONS of children throughout the nation.
This challenge is becoming EVEN GREATER now as communities make the tough decision to close schools and send children home.
"The quickest way out of fear is to get outside of yourself and to help someone else in need.

In these times we need to remember to STAND GUARD. If we don't discipline our fears &amp; control our focus, the world will gladly do it for us. YOU DECIDE.
My mentor Jim Rohn taught me, “EVERY DAY, STAND GUARD AT THE DOOR OF YOUR MIND.” You alone decide what thoughts &amp; beliefs you let into your life! What we focus on shapes whether we feel frustrated &amp; angry or excited &amp; grateful, cursed or blessed.
Turn on the TV— Is it good news about all the magnificent &amp; miraculous things humans are doing today? I wish! But we’re fed headlines that jolt us to get our precious attention. And they’re competing with the screen in our pocket, social media, &amp; alerts every moment of the day.
We're living in unique times where the volume of fear &amp; anxiety is turned up. If we don’t think critically for ourselves, we’re letting someone else dictate our focus. We can’t forget that WE’RE IN CHARGE of what to FOCUS on AND what it MEANS AND what we should do.
"So we gotta decide --
1⃣What to FOCUS ON
2⃣What it MEANS
3⃣What we’re gonna DO about it."
And soon as we FOCUS on something we GIVE IT A MEANING. Is this the end or the beginning? Is this a blessing or a curse? Whichever meaning we decide controls what we FEEL, and out of our feelings come all of our ACTIONS.
"If we have the courage to ignore the ""prophets of doom,"" the best opportunities come in times of maximum pessimism.

If we focused on that advantage, we’d feel very differently, wouldn’t we? See, FOCUS = FEELING."
But what if we shift FOCUS? What if we said: Everybody's scared &amp; freaking out! It's a perfect time for us to take a different approach because, as Warren Buffett teaches, don’t panic when others get scared by headlines.
What we CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON affects our whole life. Whatever we focus on, we FEEL— whether it's true or not. If right now you're focused on, “The economy is going down, it’s terrible!” you’ll FEEL terrible about your economics and your actions in that area will be made in fear.
"Decisions NOT conditions, determine our destiny. There are 3 DECISIONS we’re all making every moment of our lives. In fact, you’re making the first right now: WHAT AM I GOING TO FOCUS ON?
