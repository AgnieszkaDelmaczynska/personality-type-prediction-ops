"@GerberKawasaki Securities Analysis 101

As the “risk-free” real rate of return from Treasury Bills approaches the much riskier rate of return from stocks, the value of stocks drop.

For example, if T-bills and stocks both had a 10% rate of return, everyone would just buy the former."
@lexfridman Exactly
@jhall Yes
Twitter will start incorporating mute &amp; block signals from Blue Verified (not Legacy Blue) as downvotes

@Cynical_CJ Awesome 😎
@DavidSacks 💯
So inspiring to see the newfound love of freedom of speech by the press 🥰
Meanwhile, Twitter usage (by real humans) once again reaches all-time highs
@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna Rather than rigorously pursuing truth, you are virtue-signaling to show that you are “good” in the eyes of media elite to keep one foot in both worlds

@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna Bari, this is a real question, not rhetorical. What is your opinion?
@GuyDealership Good prediction
@WholeMarsBlog Twitter is not the real world
@TomFitton @Twitter That’s what they are saying
@WallStreetSilv @micsolana Exactly. Same rules for all.
@CathieDWood @ARKInvest @GuyDealership Potentially, the biggest financial crisis ever
And soon, ladies &amp; gentlemen, the coup de grâce
@dogeofficialceo Things are rather intense right now, but maybe closer to Christmas
@Timcast Correct
@bariweiss @thehonestlypod @RoKhanna What should the consequence of doxxing someone’s real-time, exact location be? Assume your child is at that location, as mine was.

Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
Sorry, too many options. Will redo poll.
If anyone posted real-time locations &amp; addresses of NYT reporters, FBI would be investigating, there’d be hearings on Capitol Hill &amp; Biden would give speeches about end of democracy!
Unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in real-time
@pmarca Words to live by
"@alx @IFNY2775 @micsolana @JxckSweeney @ElonJet Yeah, we will add that feature. Current system isn’t clear.

A time delay on reporting location that doesn’t put people at serious risk of being killed is fine."
@TRHLofficial @IFNY2775 @micsolana 🤣🤣
@IFNY2775 @micsolana Accounts engaged in doxxing receive a temporary 7 day suspension
@RAMansour @KeithOlbermann 7 day suspension for doxxing. Some time away from Twitter is good for the soul …
@micsolana They posted my exact real-time location, basically assassination coordinates, in (obvious) direct violation of Twitter terms of service
I love Barbara Streisand lol
@IFNY2775 @micsolana Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not
@micsolana Same doxxing rules apply to “journalists” as to everyone else
@Caitlyn_Jenner Yup, recent events make that super clear!
@ashleevance @JeffBezos lol

"Last night, car carrying lil X in LA was followed by crazy stalker (thinking it was me), who later blocked car from moving &amp; climbed onto hood.

Legal action is being taken against Sweeney &amp; organizations who supported harm to my family."
"Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation. This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.

Posting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn’t a safety problem, so is ok."
@mysteriouskat @jhall Yes
@jhall Real-time posting of someone else’s location violates doxxing policy, but delayed posting of locations are ok
@DirtyTesLa @Jason Up to 7 days for human review

"@StationCDRKelly I strongly disagree. Forcing your pronouns upon others when they didn’t ask, and implicitly ostracizing those who don’t, is neither good nor kind to anyone.

As for Fauci, he lied to Congress and funded gain-of-function research that killed millions of people. Not awesome imo."

@TomFitton @Twitter @realDonaldTrump Unequivocally true. The evidence is clear and voluminous.
@ggreenwald With rare exception, the FBI seems to want to do the right thing, but there is no question that Twitter operated as a Democratic Party activist machine

"@Jason @aoscott Top Gun Maverick was great!

"@Jason @DavidSacks Most engineers don’t feel strongly about politics, but do want to work with other great engineers.

@sama ChatGPT is scary good. We are not far from dangerously strong AI.
@thevivafrei Good questions
@ggreenwald @mtaibbi True
@andst7 Thank you for helping with this important problem
@mishaboar https://t.co/L0uiMSxFTK
@neontaster ChatGPT is so much better at bullshit than they are!
@WallStreetSilv 🤣🤣
@thevivafrei True lol
@ClayTravis @Twitter @nytimes That is because The New York Times has become, for all intents and purposes, an unregistered lobbying firm for far left politicians
@WillManidis That’s just the publicly disclosed number. His actual support of Dem elections is probably over $1B. The money went somewhere, so where did it go?
@OzraeliAvi I’ve seen a lot of concerning tweets about the recent Brazil election. If those tweets are accurate, it’s possible that Twitter personnel gave preference to left wing candidates.
Twitter servers are running at Warp 9!! https://t.co/vtZZeKupC7
@Carnage4Life The safety of any AI system can be measured by its MtH (meantime to Hitler). Microsoft’s Tay chatbot of several years ago got there in ~24 hours.
@Kristennetten @pmarca Haha pretty close. Electrical closet.
@pmarca Funny thing is that there was actually a little fire at Twitter HQ earlier this week! Whole building was evacuated.
"@pmarca 🥰🥰

@micsolana Well-said
@BillyM2k Exactly
Tune in for Episode 2 of The Twitter Files tomorrow!
@lexfridman Transparency is the key to trust
@TheQuartering Q&amp;A tomorrow
@hodgetwins @micsolana Twitter acting by itself to suppress free speech is not a 1st amendment violation, but acting under orders from the government to suppress free speech, with no judicial review, is
@micsolana If this isn’t a violation of the Constitution’s First Amendment, what is?
@micsolana “Handled” 🔥🔥🔥
@mtaibbi Ro Khanna is great
@EmmanuelMacron It was an honor to see you again. Looking forward to exciting plans in France!
Here we go!! 🍿🍿 https://t.co/eILK9f3bAm
We’re double-checking some facts, so probably start live tweeting in about 40 mins
@stillgray Oh you mean the same MSM that all colluded to suppress the story? That MSM?
@stillgray 😢
This will be awesome 🍿
What really happened with the Hunter Biden story suppression by Twitter will be published on Twitter at 5pm ET!
@Jason Agreed
@johnkrausphotos Both false positives and negatives matter
Please screenshot examples that Twitter needs to fix
Not counting those behind the “see more replies” aka probable spam button
"Major Twitter system improvements were implemented this week to drop hammer hard on spam/scam accounts.

Taking just past 24 hours, does it seem like there are far fewer?"
"Twitter is now serving almost 90 billion tweet impressions per day!

Just how incredibly alive the system actually is will become obvious as we show view count on all tweets."
@EvaFoxU @nytimes 🤣🤣
@BillyM2k Agreed
There are about 500M tweets per day &amp; billions of impressions, so hate speech impressions are &lt;0.1% of what’s seen on Twitter!
@nytimes Utterly false
@Ravii_kc We will publish stats on Love Speech too, as it is vastly higher than Hate Speech!
"Hate speech impressions (# of times tweet was viewed) continue to decline, despite significant user growth!

@TwitterSafety will publish data weekly.

Freedom of speech doesn’t mean freedom of reach. Negativity should &amp; will get less reach than positivity. https://t.co/36zl29rCSM"
@Kristennetten Please report accounts doing so. Repeated harassment falls into the spam category, so will result in a temp suspension.
@kylenabecker That resulted in a major spike. Twitter will be publishing actual “hate speech” (same list company has always used) impressions later today &amp; every week going forward.
@BillyM2k The (currently) quiet majority should tweet more!
"You know Twitter is being fair when extremists on far right and far left are simultaneously upset!

Twitter aims to serve center 80% of people, who wish to learn, laugh &amp; engage in reasoned debate. ❤️"
@stillgray Right on schedule 🤣🤣
@shortword @M3Marcel @WholeMarsBlog Current efficiency is 1.7kWh/mile, but there is a clear path to 1.6, possibly 1.5
@andst7 I have Sam Gamgee’s words on my bedside table
FAFO
"@KimDotcom @kanyewest Just clarifying that his account is being suspended for incitement to violence, not an unflattering pic of me being hosed by Ari. 

Frankly, I found those pics to be helpful motivation to lose weight!"
@TheeAleexJ @kanyewest I tried my best. Despite that, he again violated our rule against incitement to violence. Account will be suspended.
@kanyewest This is not
@kanyewest That is fine
@alex_avoigt This is silly. Only two numbers are needed to calculate range: battery energy density and average vehicle energy consumed per unit distance.

@JamieHutchens4 How many views do your tweets get?
"@yvanleterrible2 We aren’t doing well at surfacing tweets from less prominent handles, as it’s almost impossible to distinguish between authentic humans vs bots/trolls. 

This is why $8/month with phone and optional ID verification, as well as organizational affiliation, is so important."
AI is getting really good https://t.co/OwQgDi4wun
@dcherring @araghougassian @Spooks Exactly. That’s why I’m encouraging people to interact with Twitter more!
@WokeArchive 🤣
"@jordanbpeterson Compared to AI, progress with Neuralink will be slow and easy to assess, as there is large regulatory apparatus approving medical devices.

There is no regulatory oversight of AI, which is a *major* problem. I’ve been calling for AI safety regulation for over a decade!"
@araghougassian @Spooks View count will show how many people actually see tweets, just as is done for videos. You will sometimes have a video view count of 1M with only 20k likes!
"@araghougassian @Spooks The problem is that likes are public, subjecting people to criticism, and “like” is often the wrong description, as you often just think something is interesting or notable, but not likable. 

We need to add these critical distinctions."
@Spooks Twitter will start showing view count for all tweets, just as view count is shown for all videos. The system is far more alive than it would seem.
"@Spooks Have you clicked on your tweet analytics (little bar graph)? 

Those who read tweets outnumber those who reply/retweet/like tweets by over 1000%."
"I meet so many people who read twitter every day, but almost never tweet.

If I may beg your indulgence, please add your voice to the public dialogue!"
@TrungTPhan 🤣
@westcoastbill Agreed
@verdouglasgomes @nandorappa40 Looking into it

"@zswitten There still isn’t a good strawberry picking robot, but researchers are working on it.

"@EvaFoxU @Reuters Exactly. The obvious reality, as long-time users know, is that Twitter has failed in trust &amp; safety for a very long time and has interfered in elections. 

Twitter 2.0 will be far more effective, transparent and even-handed."
Update from @Neuralink at 6pm PT
@NorthmanTrader @vincent13031925 Exactly
@vincent13031925 Trend is concerning. Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately. They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.
@teslaownersSV Much more, but I am simply stating the obvious

@DavidSacks This is a serious problem
@mtracey This makes sense
The people have spoken …
If Community Notes can correct me, then obviously they can correct anyone. This is a good example. They were right to add the label.
@TheQuartering I think I have been very specific
@DavidSacks It’s a real problem. Apple and Google effectively control access to most of the Internet via their app stores.
@cb_doge @stillgray @ezralevant @latimes That one was real too
"@stillgray @ezralevant @latimes The reason satire about CNN proposing censorship of Twitter could so easily be construed as reality is because that is the prevailing sentiment of the media!

Satire is reveals a deeper truth."

This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.
@SwipeWright This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.
@BillyM2k Exactly
@saylor @lexfridman Absolutely, especially if done in collusion with the government
The Twitter Files on free speech suppression soon to be published on Twitter itself. The public deserves to know what really happened …
@RubinReport Why are so many in the media against free speech? This is messed up.

Did you know Apple puts a secret 30%  tax on everything you buy through their App Store? https://t.co/LGkPZ4EYcz
Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why
@LBRYcom Secret suppression of free speech by Apple. Customers were never told. What the hell is going on here?
@jake_k Yes
Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers

@BillyM2k You probably weren’t blocking 4000 accounts per second
@VassiliosBitsas Friends have asked me if there’s a way to recover their old vine videos! Will look into it.
@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k System obviously needs immediate alerts for any sudden spike in database writes of any kind
@RyanZohoury @BillyM2k That’s literally how I found out!
@johnkrausphotos It’s on the todo list
Twitter experienced slight degradation of service today from an old 3rd party tool used to block accounts that had no rate limit (sigh). Should be fixed now.

@SamTwits More importantly, I was head of product and led the design of the original Roadster. Eberhard was wealthy and could have risked his money, but was unwilling to do so.
@stillgray For many celebrities, it’s actually their manager or “team” writing their tweets. Might be the case here.

My preference for the 2024 presidency is someone sensible and centrist. I had hoped that would the case for the Biden administration, but have been disappointed so far."
@TimRunsHisMouth As a reminder, I was a significant supporter of the Obama-Biden presidency and (reluctantly) voted for Biden over Trump
@mtaibbi Interesting development
"@TimRunsHisMouth I’m fine with Trump not tweeting. The important thing is that Twitter correct a grave mistake in banning his account, despite no violation of the law or terms of service.

Deplatforming a sitting President undermined public trust in Twitter for half of America."

@marshallk @Esqueer_ Calling for violence will result in suspension
@marshallk @Esqueer_ Absolutely
"@Esqueer_ Incitement to violence will result in account suspension.

Twitter will be a forum for the peaceful exchange of views."
@stillgray Accurate
@MattWallace888 @saylor @Cryptoking @RBReich If it actually becomes a problem, we will take those and other steps

@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul That is a disturbing story and very concerning that Twitter took no action, despite clear violation of ToS. Report in this thread for now.
"@Cryptoking @RBReich All verified individual humans will have same blue check, as boundary of what constitutes “notable” is otherwise too subjective.

Individuals can have secondary tiny logo showing they belong to an org if verified as such by that org.

Longer explanation next week."
@MrAndyNgo @ramzpaul Incitement to violence will result in account suspension
"@Cryptoking @RBReich Sorry for the delay, we’re tentatively launching Verified on Friday next week. 

Gold check for companies, grey check for government, blue for individuals (celebrity or not) and all verified accounts will be manually authenticated before check activates. 

Painful, but necessary."
@RBReich Interesting … now pay $8
@stillgray @axios Much Ado About Nothing
@AP But you have piqued my curiosity … who are these “online experts” you speak of?
@AP AP is such an expert in misinformation. Twitter couldn’t hope to compete!
@ThePrashanthCB @viniciuscfp82 Mars plans are still moving forward
@viniciuscfp82 How can it be both illegal and “by the court”? Twitter must abide by the laws of each country or get shut down.

@nichegamer @brandonorselli @semaforben That’s why he won’t answer
@semaforben To be direct, the very real concern here is that you have been pushing a completely false SBF ownership of Twitter narrative while effectively being his paid shill.
"@semaforben All public holders of Twitter were allowed to roll their stock into Twitter as a private company, but he did not do so. Your reporting made it falsely sound like he did, when in fact he owns 0%.

@David_Ingram @semaforben @semafor No. He may have owned shares in Twitter as a public company, but he certainly does not own shares in Twitter as a private company.
@karaswisher There was a time when you cared about the truth. That is long gone.
"@semaforben @semafor As I said, neither I nor Twitter have taken any investment from SBF/FTX. Your article is a lie. 

Now, I’m asking again, how much of you does SBF own?"

@wizecrax @stillgray @kylenabecker @Twitter This is messed up
@kylenabecker @Twitter As is obvious to all but the media, there is not one permanent ban on even the most far left account spouting utter lies
@kylenabecker @Twitter True
@waitbutwhy It is shocking how many journalists viscously attack free speech, but somehow think they’re the good guys!
@BillyM2k the olden daze
@jakeshieldsajj Indeed
@R6BTuxYEfbGYIoB What do you mean?
@WSJ @WSJopinion @AllysiaFinley .@CommunityNotes 🙌
Wait, if I Tweet does that count as work?
@SirineAti @Anc_Aesthetics Twitter
@PPathole @Anc_Aesthetics Yeah, about 6 months ago
@Syndicate I see a path
@TeslaGong @CSMFHT It’s coming
@teslaownersSV @CSMFHT Looking into it
@Anc_Aesthetics Pretty sure that was in Elden Ring
@unusual_whales Perhaps not unreasonable to know if anything was accomplished 🫶
This will improve a lot as Twitter becomes fast to use outside of North America, Western Europe &amp; Japan
"@CSMFHT Pupienus Maximus!

@sama Plot twist!
@dogeofficialceo @MrBeast Written content too
@MrBeast Let’s see what happens when Twitter offers good video with higher compensation for creators …
The Tactics of Mistake
@mosstache 💯🎯🤣
Twitter added 1.6M daily active users this past week, another all-time high https://t.co/Si3cRYnvyD
"Holding off relaunch of Blue Verified until there is high confidence of stopping impersonation. 

Will probably use different color check for organizations than individuals."
@egoraptor lmao
@PPathole Dune. Amazing to think it was written in 1965!
@WSJ @WSJopinion @AllysiaFinley Yeah umm … that is definitely not the reason it failed
@Jason 🤣
Starlink now works for high latitudes https://t.co/Ngdh8CJbCJ
Tesla Megapacks are highly effective in addressing electricity demand spikes that cause power outages https://t.co/V4n5c4ZvNH
@JamesSpiro @Israel @taylorswift13 I have! It was great.
@cb_doge @DanSum519 @stillgray Not many tbh
@Israel @taylorswift13 Your tweets are good! More countries should tweet like this. No fun being all stuffy.
Experience: what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted - Igor
@DanSum519 @stillgray Oh they’ll be back on Twitter, if they even actually left. This platform is like pharmaceutical-grade crack to them.
@stillgray I am having a great time 🤣🤣
Fanaticism is always a function of repressed doubt – Dune
Namaste 🙏
@mysteriouskat It’s a reverse, reverse psychology trick
@mysteriouskat 👀
@waitbutwhy Absolutely
@lenjin2 @catturd2 I like his music tbh, but maybe Etsy is more his style
Hope all judgy hall monitors stay on other platforms – please, I’m begging u
@rhemrajani9 Feels so long ago 🤭
@lexfridman It is so entertaining!
Twitter is fun 🚀 💫 ♥️
@KimDotcom @BillFOXLA @FoxNews Behavior follows the incentives for political power
@lexfridman Good times :)
@LanceUlanoff @Rainmaker1973 Then let us work to make the future better
"@rationalwalk @BillFOXLA @FoxNews We should actively recruit the best &amp; brightest to part of the United States! 

That is what every championship sports team does."
@micsolana So unfair! 🤣
@MrStevenSteele @catturd2 🤣
@catturd2 And it turns out that Trent “nine inch nails” Reznor is actually a crybaby 🤣
@Rainmaker1973 I can’t think of a worse curse than living forever
@BillFOXLA @FoxNews Seems bizarre that it’s so easy enter illegally, but so hard to get a legal work visa
"@KimDotcom @SamHarrisOrg My firstborn child died in my arms. I felt his last heartbeat. 

I have no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame."
@teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU Oh man, that’s a long story, but if we haven’t cut response time in half by end of year, I will hang my head in shame
@BLKMDL3 @EvaFoxU Latter
@teslaownersSV @EvaFoxU Yes, major focus on video overall
@EvaFoxU Priority #1
@SamHarrisOrg Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven
@EvaFoxU Falcon is powered by 9 merkins!
Our love will never die https://t.co/y5SldfAAt0
And lead us not into temptation … https://t.co/8qNOXzwXS9
@EvaFoxU So tempting …
@HappyJesse Yes
"@kanyewest Don’t kill what ye hate
Save what ye love"
@teslaownersSV @kcoleman Making good progress. Still tracking to wide release next month.
"World Cup Qatar 2022: Opening Ceremony

"@TimRunsHisMouth So you say “mainstream media” is biased? 

Hmm, will have to fact-check that with mainstream media.

Nope, they say everything is cool!"
@RaheemKassam They just can’t stop writing about Twitter, which is driving usage through roof lmao
@catturd2 One thing is for sure: it’s not boring https://t.co/47uPkl88gZ
@kcoleman Exactly
@stillgray @mtaibbi “All the news that’s fit to print” my ass
@CBSNewsPress 🤭
@Starbie888 @NateSilver538 [Cue Spider-Man meme]
@Starbie888 @NateSilver538 What could be more fun than a social network consisting entirely of hall monitors!?
@NateSilver538 🤣🤣💯🎯
@mtaibbi It is tragic how far The New York Times has fallen – basically just boring af far left brainwashing at this point. The boring part is truly unforgivable!
World Cup starts soon! Follow on Twitter for best coverage by far.
@WholeMarsBlog 🤣
@TomFitton Sure as night follows day …
@JGreenblattADL @ADL Hey stop defaming me!
@naiivememe 🔥🔥
Twitter is ALIVE
@EMTSLA @teslaownersSV @RaheemKassam @nypost Good idea
@teslaownersSV @RaheemKassam @nypost Their posts are super boring
@RaheemKassam @nypost They should bring Walter Cronkite back
@nypost Oh forget it who cares
@RenataKonkoly @nypost 🤣💯
@nypost Who made this decision?
@BuzzPatterson 😉
@KimDotcom Twitter engineering is working on it
@sriramk Server load is insane rn. Good stress test before World Cup tomorrow!
@DavidSacks Well-said
@LefterisJP Lmaooo
@TrungTPhan 🤣🤣
"The people have spoken. 

Trump will be reinstated.

Vox Populi, Vox Dei. https://t.co/jmkhFuyfkv"
@TheBabylonBee 🤣 but actually
@MomAngtrades 🤣
134M people have seen this poll
@TrungTPhan Red Bull does work tbh
@BillyM2k @lexfridman Definitely need to improve Twitter’s dopamine/cortisol ratio!
@BillyM2k @waitbutwhy I agree
@micsolana 🤣🤣
The most entertaining outcome is the most likely – my variant on Occam’s Razor
@alexxubyte Twitter search will add feedback loops to improve result rank based on which result you click on &amp; whether you immediately click back (implies wrong result)
"@alexxubyte Notes from last night:
- Maybe deprecate TLS this week, as only needed if Android app &gt;1 year old.
- Home mixer computes Home  ~10X faster than Timeline.
- Ad mixer can greatly improve relevance at cost of lower total ad views. More interesting the ad, more time you look at it."
@ErrolWebber Most accurate would be to require access to phone GPS for location-specific polls
@ErrolWebber Yes
Fascinating to watch Twitter Trump poll!
@Nomad_1x Bot &amp; troll armies might be running out of steam soon. Some interesting lessons to clean up future polls.
@DavidSacks Good question
@WholeMarsBlog Most amount of people I’ve ever seen in the building by far
@micsolana 🤣🤣
@Jason @DavidSacks @Zappos That was certainly my intention too!
Tesla FSD 10.69.3.1 going to wide release now
Just leaving Twitter HQ code review https://t.co/pYcXRTJm14
@Nomad_1x The bot attack is impressive to watch!
Trump poll getting ~1M votes/hour!
@micsolana Can’t tell if this is parody or real
@jack @Lucididy @jordanbpeterson Verification through the payment system plus phones, but allowing pseudonyms is the least bad solution I can think of
@saylor When polls are about a significant question, even those who don’t follow me tend to hear about it. That said, I agree with the idea of an all-user poll. Should also be an all-user by country poll.
@lexfridman Agreed
Vox Populi, Vox Dei
Reinstate former President Trump
@thevivafrei @paraga @jack Too bad
@S3XYstarship @slashdot DoJ Antitrust @JusticeATR
"@slashdot App store fees are obviously too high due to the iOS/Android duopoly. 

It is a hidden 30% tax on the Internet."
@Tesmanian_com Kind of him to say. I look forward to meeting.
@TrungTPhan 🤣
First World Cup match on Sunday! Watch on Twitter for best coverage &amp; real-time commentary.
@BillyM2k Exactly
@Benioff Thanks Marc ❤️
@HardcoreNolley No
Note, this applies just to the individual tweet, not the whole account
@TheBabylonBee If only there had been a way … 🤣🤣
"Kathie Griffin, Jorden Peterson &amp; Babylon Bee have been reinstated.

Trump decision has not yet been made."
"New Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.

Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted &amp; demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter. 

You won’t find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet."
Freedom Fridays …
@BillyM2k Jazz hands 🤗
What should Twitter do next?
@Yemen_770 🤣
@micsolana You don’t say …
@SamTwits Of course not ❤️
@DrKrusher 🥱
@MikeDulaimi I stand corrected!
https://t.co/OjhQJvruTy
@lionxmah @folha ?
@AOC You’re welcome
@WholeMarsBlog Record numbers of users are logging in to see if Twitter is dead, ironically making it more alive than ever!
@piersmorgan Seriously
https://t.co/JU073T756X
https://t.co/rbwbsLA1ZG
🏴‍☠️
@ashleevance 🤣
Let that sink in …
And … we just hit another all-time high in Twitter usage lol
@stoolpresidente The best people are staying, so I’m not super worried
@bgurley @MichaelGuimarin Don’t wanna jinx it, but there’s a chance we can keep Twitter alive … https://t.co/mk3aCq0dEB
@anothercohen Thanks for helping out. You’re a lifesaver!
@MichaelGuimarin Thanks!
"How do you make a small fortune in social media?

Start out with a large one."
@growing_daniel @micsolana 🤣
@EvaFoxU The media constantly writing about Twitter is driving usage to all-time highs, so it’s fine by me!
@MinimalDuck @Tesla Cybertruck is something special that comes along once in a long while
"@heydave7 Current class-action law is actually a massive tax on the American people and desperately needs reform. It is one of the reasons medication is so expensive in the USA.

Somehow, other countries do just fine without class-action law."
@heydave7 The actual attackers in class-action lawsuits are the law firms. They just find someone in the class to be their puppet.
@AutismCapital Ok
@chazman We’re working on something that should rank replies automatically
Twitter is like open-sourcing the news
@dogeofficialceo Polycule 🔥🔥
@sama Probably
@Dilbert_Daily Even TikTok is super dependent on ads
SBF is ineffective altruism, but they thought he was saying he was in effective altruism. Easy misunderstanding.
@growing_daniel @jeremiahscholl I don’t wanna brag but … it’s true
@minliangtan Definitely
Not to mention the sickkk memes lol
Coverage of FTX meltdown is incomparably faster *and* better quality on Twitter than old-school media
@BillyM2k @adamscochran @accretionist Ability to do long tweets coming soon
@westcoastbill https://t.co/O9quYfsUqV
@AutismCapital It’s not his fault, society is to blame. Arrest society!
@SaladBarFan 🎯
@DavidSacks I believe in vice-signaling
@laurenweinstein @stocktalkweekly Correct. I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place, which will take some time.
@jack Magic 🎱 knows all
@amitkgupta84 @Jason Literally working on that tonight
@paulg People have no idea how fast Twitter will evolve
@WholeMarsBlog Yep
@realGeorgeHotz @boing Sure, let’s talk.
"@jimmyfallon Wait a second, how do we know you’re not an alien body snatcher pretending to be Jimmy!? 

Say something that only the real Jimmy would say …"
@rising_serpent Why is that?
@jimmyfallon Sounds like a job for @CommunityNotes!
@bowx_ To heir is human, to forgive, divine (something like that)
@jimmyfallon Fix what?
@Mrwhosetheboss Maybe
@NASA @NASAArtemis @NASA_SLS @NASA_Orion Congratulations!!
@JuliusSinghania @wongmjane X will be the everything app
@yukaichou I’m the taint haha
