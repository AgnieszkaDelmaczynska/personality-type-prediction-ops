The Puerto Rico Status Act will empower the people of Puerto Rico to choose for themselves how to move forward: statehood, independence or sovereignty in free association with the United States.
For more than a century, Puerto Rico has been governed under a political system imposed by outside forces rather than established by its people. Denied the right to a vote in Congress or for President, Puerto Rico’s territorial status has left it vulnerable to unequal treatment.
"Today's passage of #HR8393 is a key step to ensure Puerto Rico’s future is one of its own choosing. 
 
With the Puerto Rico Status Act, the House voted to tear down the vestiges of colonialism – honoring the dignity, equality and rights of more than 3 million American citizens."

More must be done to save lives – which is why @HouseDemocrats have passed legislation to reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban, more efficiently warn communities during an active shooting and secure universal background checks. We will not rest until these vital measures become law.
Endlessly inspired by courageous survivors and families transforming their anguish into action, Democrats have led the charge to combat the scourge of gun violence. This summer, @POTUS &amp; @HouseDemocrats enacted the first major gun violence prevention law in nearly three decades.
10 years ago, Newtown and our nation were shaken by an unfathomable act of evil: 20 precious schoolchildren and 6 devoted educators slaughtered at Sandy Hook Elementary School. This monstrous rampage robbed innocent children of their futures and left loved ones forever shattered.

For nearly 10 months, Brittney Griner suffered unthinkable trauma as she was wrongfully imprisoned by Russia. Putin’s cruelty against Brittney – and his monstrous actions against Ukraine – are reminders of his brazen contempt for human rights, human dignity and the rule of law.

Once signed into law, the Respect for Marriage Act will prevent right-wing extremists from uprooting legal precedent, tearing away fundamental freedoms and upending the lives of families across the country.
Since the Supreme Court’s monstrous decision overturning Roe, extreme MAGA Republicans have set their sights on additional freedoms. In his opinion, Clarence Thomas explicitly called on the Court to reconsider the right to marriage equality handed down in its Obergefell decision.
Today, the Senate took an historic step forward in Democrats’ fight to defend freedom, dignity and equality. The Respect for Marriage Act will uphold marriage equality under federal law – tearing the bigoted, unconstitutional 'Defense of Marriage Act’ off the books for good.

Today’s Supreme Court ruling upholds our Democracy, the rule of law and the Congress’ ability to execute its legislative and oversight responsibilities. Now, the Congress must enact legislation requiring Presidents and candidates for President to disclose their tax returns.

The attack on Club Q, on the eve of Transgender Day of Remembrance, is despicable — further shattering the sense of safety of LGBTQ Americans across the country. While Democrats have taken steps to combat gun violence, this deadly attack is a reminder that we must do more.
Americans awoke this morning to horrific news: a brutal attack on an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs. Our hearts break at the senseless slaughter of least five beautiful souls and the many more injured or forever traumatized, at what was a sanctuary of safety and solidarity.
Together, we will continue forging a safer, more just America – one where all of its people can freely and proudly exercise their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. https://t.co/6KZjiOyz8q
"Horrified by such shameless bigotry, House Democrats are proud to march alongside our trans friends, neighbors and siblings as we work to uphold justice for all. 
 
That is why we have enacted fully-inclusive federal hate crime protections and twice passed the Equality Act."
"Today, and every day, let us offer comfort to grieving loved ones, honor those killed and continue fighting to save lives from the wicked forces of hate.

Thanks to the visionary leadership of @POTUS, and strengthened by the brilliance of @RepPeterDeFazio, America is back on track to have infrastructure that is the envy of the world – and can support a thriving 21st Century economy.
At the same time, this law advances @HouseDemocrats’ unyielding commitment to equity and justice: getting lead out of drinking water, expanding broadband access in rural areas, and cleaning up legacy pollution in underserved communities.
Across the country, communities are already seeing the impacts of this landmark law. Shovels are in the ground right now, repairing roads and bridges, improving airports and waterways, and investing in passenger rail and public transit.
A year ago today, America took a giant leap forward to rebuild our nation while rebuilding our middle class. When @POTUS signed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we seized an opportunity to strengthen our nation’s crumbling infrastructure, create jobs and reconnect communities. https://t.co/6rCjXsYjaG

Making them law will be a top priority for a Dem Majority next Congress. In stark contrast, MAGA Republicans’ extreme agenda would make inflation much worse: plotting to repeal lower prescription drug costs, give tax breaks to the ultra-rich &amp; slash Social Security and Medicare.
.@HouseDemocrats have gone further: passing the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act, the Lower Food &amp; Fuel Costs Act, and historic investments in paid leave, Child Tax Credit, child care, home health care, universal pre-K and affordable housing.
Democrats have enacted landmark laws to lower the cost of living for families: lowering prescription drug costs and cutting health care premiums, while gas prices have come down.
This has been made possible by Dems’ bold action: from our Rescue Plan to our Infrastructure Law to our CHIPS &amp; Science Law to our Inflation Reduction Act. Shamefully, Republicans overwhelmingly voted against these laws – even rooting for a recession.
Now, with more than 10 million new jobs — including a record 700,000 new manufacturing jobs — Americans continue to get back to work and our economy continues to grow.
The October jobs numbers are the latest evidence that, under President Biden and the Democratic Congress, America continues to create jobs at a strong, steady, sustainable pace.

Republicans are pledging to repeal the lower drug costs and 158 House Republicans have already endorsed an extreme MAGA plan to privatize Social Security, raise the retirement age and end Medicare as we know it.
Yet with Social Security &amp; Medicare as essential as ever, extreme MAGA Republicans are openly plotting new schemes to slash seniors’ benefits &amp; raise their costs – including by threatening to cause an economic catastrophe by holding the debt limit hostage for their toxic agenda.
The increase in Social Security benefits, together with the historic action that Democrats have delivered to lower seniors’ prescription drug costs with the Inflation Reduction Act, shows the vital role Medicare and Social Security provide to protect seniors from rising costs.
This year’s cost-of-living boost in benefits is an important reminder that Social Security is the bedrock of financial security for America’s seniors in challenging times. Yet extreme MAGA Republicans are doubling down on slashing Social Security &amp; Medicare.

https://t.co/zUDyslSWhm"
But now, extreme MAGA Republicans want to repeal these lower costs and make health care more expensive for seniors and families.
For seniors, the Inflation Reduction Act dramatically lowered prescription drug costs: capping out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000, empowering Medicare to negotiate for lower prices and banning predatory price hikes faster than inflation.
In our American Rescue Plan, we slashed ACA premiums for working families – and then locked in those savings with our Inflation Reduction Act.
This means that, under President Biden and a Democratic Congress, 14 million Americans have gained the dignity and security of lower health care costs. This is the latest step in Democrats’ relentless fight to lower health costs.
Today, the Treasury Department finalizes the fix so that, when Open Enrollment begins on November 1st, nearly a million more Americans will see lower premiums or gain affordable coverage.
In April, @POTUS took a powerful step to make health care more affordable and accessible by ending the “family glitch” in the Affordable Care Act — strengthening the law so that it functions as Congress intended.

At the same time, while Democrats are lowering kitchen table costs for families with our #InflationReductionAct, @HouseGOP has put forth an extreme MAGA agenda that would raise prescription drug prices, slash Social Security and Medicare, and diminish our economy.
"This progress was powered by Democrats’ economic agenda: from our Rescue Plan to our Infrastructure Law to our CHIPS and Science Act.

Failed federal drug policies — which have specifically targeted communities of color — have torn apart too many families. By pardoning those arrested for simple marijuana possession, and encouraging governors to follow suit, the President is advancing racial and economic justice.
This is a day of hope and healing, as @POTUS takes historic steps to reform America’s approach to marijuana. These transformative actions are the latest manifestation of Democrats’ unyielding commitment to justice, especially for those unfairly harmed by cannabis criminalization.

✅ Caps seniors’ out-of-pocket drug costs at $2000 a year and insulin at $35 a month
✅ Secures free vaccines for seniors
✅ Prevents predatory price hikes"
".@HouseDemocrats' #InflationReductionAct delivers historic action to lower prescription drug prices for America’s seniors.
 
But @HouseGOP’s Extreme MAGA Agenda will repeal those lower costs –  hiking prices on seniors to give billions back to Big Pharma. https://t.co/jQZhT8ceo9"
The contrast is crystal clear: Democrats are For The People, while Republicans are For Their Power. The American people will Remember in November that House Republicans’ extreme MAGA agenda is far too dangerous — for our families and for our Democracy. https://t.co/MdNYkbZCn0
But this extreme MAGA agenda is way out of step with Americans’ priorities, who align with Democrats’ vision of putting #PeopleOverPolitics: with lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities.
This alarming new extreme MAGA platform threatens to criminalize women’s health care, slash seniors’ Medicare and raise prescription drug prices, and attack our free and fair elections.
Today’s rollout is the latest evidence of House Republicans’ whole-hearted Commitment to MAGA: going all-in on an extremist agenda designed to greatly diminish Americans’ health, freedom and security.
.@HouseDemocrats know every American deserves to live in a safe community – where they &amp; their family can thrive. This public safety package is the latest manifestation of our commitment to putting #PeopleOverPolitics &amp; building safer communities for all. https://t.co/Ml0wp0DLSt

Today is a day of important progress on one of @HouseDemocrats’ top priorities: building safer communities. The #InvestToProtectAct we passed today – rooted in Democrats’ values of safety &amp; justice – takes a strong step to prevent crime, save lives &amp; advance justice.

https://t.co/elBNeo9W0b"
With Roe now out of their way, extreme MAGA Republicans are gleefully charging ahead with their deadly crusade to punish and control women’s health decisions.
Meanwhile, House Republicans have overwhelmingly backed criminalizing abortion nationwide, rejecting women’s right to travel for health care and even eliminating the right to birth control.
Instead of fighting actual crime, Republicans would drag doctors off to prison, while forcing ER physicians to focus on the threat of prosecution instead of the emergency medical care owed their patients.
We are already seeing the agonizing reality of the radical bans enacted by radical right-wing state legislatures – and extreme MAGA Republicans in Congress clearly want to inflict this same suffering on every woman in every state.
Make no mistake: if Republicans get the chance, they will work to pass laws even more draconian than this bill – just like the bans they have enacted in states like Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma.
The nationwide abortion ban proposal put forth today is the latest, clearest signal of extreme MAGA Republicans intent to criminalize women’s health freedom in all 50 states and arrest doctors for providing basic care.

While we pray that time may ease the grief and pain inflicted two decades ago, it cannot diminish our love for those taken from us or our debt to those heroes who gave their lives to save others.
Recognizing our responsibility to those who donned a uniform in the wake of September 11th, @POTUS signed the Honoring our PACT Act last month – expanding access to life-saving care for millions of veterans across the country.
Congress has worked to honor those whose bravery lit our way through one of the darkest moments in American history: securing vital support for 9/11 heroes and their families with the James Zadroga 9/11 Health &amp; Compensation Act and the Never Forget the Heroes Act.
While images of smoke and rubble are forever etched into our collective memory, so too is evidence of America’s extraordinary resilience: first responders racing toward scenes of destruction, communities rallying together and a generation of patriots stepping forward to serve.
"On this morning 21 years ago, unfathomable acts of terror wreaked destruction on U.S. soil: shattering Americans’ sense of security and forever changing our nation.

As we remember the 3,000 precious souls stolen away from us, we pray for the families left behind."

May it be a comfort to her children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and the entire Royal Family that Americans join them in prayer at this sad time. https://t.co/ZsmIDDJpus
Personally, it was an honor to be on the Floor of the House during her historic address to the Congress in 1991 and to welcome her as Speaker on her important visit to the United States in 2007, which deepened the special relationship between our nations.
Her extraordinary life and leadership will continue to inspire young women and girls in public service, now and for generations to come.
She took an important step toward hope and healing in 2011, when she made history as the first British monarch to visit Ireland in a century. Under history’s brightest spotlight, Queen Elizabeth offered a masterclass in grace and strength, power and poise.
Her Majesty capably shepherded the United Kingdom through great turbulence and transition. As the Head of the Commonwealth, she helped advance a new global order of security, prosperity and peace.
On behalf of the United States Congress, I extend our deepest and most sincere condolences to the Royal Family during this sad time. Queen Elizabeth embodied the highest spirit of civic duty: earning the reverence of her people and the respect of the world.
Today, Americans join the people of the United Kingdom in mourning the sad passing of Queen Elizabeth II. Over her seven decades on the throne, Her Majesty was a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedom.

With the GOP’s utter disdain for our health, safety and freedom, it is only a matter of time that another drug, treatment, vaccine or health service becomes the next target of their extremism.
Since then, House Republicans have plotted an unhinged, dangerous campaign to punish our most personal decisions, from abortion care to birth control and more.
This extreme MAGA ruling comes just months after the Republican-controlled Supreme Court discarded precedent and privacy in overturning Roe v. Wade.
This decision also threatens vital preventative health services guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act, including birth control, vaccinations and routine health screenings.
This disturbing decision amounts to open homophobia: unleashing unthinkable suffering and death specifically among the LGBTQ community.
Today, a radical, Republican-appointed federal judge ruled that employers can deny coverage for PrEP: a drug proven to save lives from HIV/AIDS and a key strategy for ending the epidemic.
"The Republican-stacked Supreme Court overturning Roe opened the door to more right-wing attacks on women – including our right to contraception.

No one should be denied access to birth control. 

@HouseDemocrats’ Right to Contraception Act protects this fundamental freedom."
"Under the leadership of the most pro-union President in our history, Democrats are also widening the path to prosperity by creating good-paying, union-protected jobs.
https://t.co/TTolhjN7UV"
The Democratic House has twice passed the Richard L. Trumka PRO Act to tear down these barriers and empower every American to fight for the just wages, fair benefits and fundamental dignity that they have earned.
Despite unions’ soaring popularity, Americans still face outrageous hurdles to exercising their most basic rights on the job – from union-busting corporations to broken, outdated labor laws.
Indeed, seven in ten non-union workers would consider organizing if given the opportunity – and @HouseDemocrats are committed to giving them that chance.
".@POTUS and Congressional Democrats are proud to fight alongside a burgeoning labor movement as we put #PeopleOverPolitics.

Because we know that the middle class is the backbone of our Democracy – and the middle class has a union label on it."
This year, while marking the transformative achievements of America’s labor movement throughout our history, we celebrate an organizing wave that is reaching workplaces across the nation – from coffee shops and warehouses to newsrooms and ballparks.

1. Criminalize women’s health care by banning abortion nationwide
2. Harm seniors by dismantling Social Security &amp; Medicare
3. Attack Democracy by undermining elections

Republicans are For Their Power. Democrats put #PeopleOverPolitics."
"Thanks to @POTUS and @HouseDemocrats commitment to #MakeItInAmerica, American manufacturing has come roaring back.
 
Since January 2021, our economy has added 660,000 manufacturing jobs. And major American companies have announced new plans to expand production on our shores."
"In August, America created 315,000 jobs – continuing our strong, steady job growth.
 
Democrats’ Rescue Plan &amp; Infrastructure Law sparked this robust recovery. Now, we’re building on this momentum with our job-creating, cost-cutting CHIPS &amp; Science and Inflation Reduction laws."
Every day, Democrats are putting People Over Politics: lower costs, better-paying jobs and safer communities for all of America’s families. Read my full statement on the August Jobs Report here: https://t.co/tGLiBXvQhk
Our CHIPS &amp; Science Act will create good-paying jobs in American semiconductor manufacturing &amp; technological innovation. Our #InflationReductionAct will deliver 9 million new jobs in clean energy, while slashing prescription drug costs for seniors &amp; energy bills for families.
This robust and ongoing jobs recovery was sparked by Democrats’ American Rescue Plan and furthered by our Infrastructure Law. Now, we are building on this momentum to lower kitchen table costs and create more opportunities for our workers.
The American people are rejecting Republicans’ extreme MAGA agenda – instead, choosing Democrats’ unifying vision of #PeopleOverPolitics. Read my full statement on President Biden’s Address on Defending Democracy here: https://t.co/VDNKBhn9Eq
In stark contrast, under the strong leadership of @POTUS, Democrats have powered progress for America’s families. With our landmark laws to bring down costs, create better paying jobs and build safer communities, Democrats are demonstrating that Democracy can continue to deliver.
Extreme MAGA Republicans are orchestrating a sinister campaign. By criminalizing women's health care, ending Social Security &amp; Medicare &amp; undermining our elections, the GOP is working to turn back the clock on fundamental liberties while fanning the flames of violence &amp; division.
Every American who cares about the integrity of our Democracy, the fairness of our economy, the safety of our communities and the health of our planet is grateful to the President for his values-based vision and patriotic leadership.
Tonight, @POTUS Biden, in his inspiring and optimistic remarks, made crystal clear that our rights, our freedom and our Democracy are on the line.
"In the days ahead, we will continue to work with Chairman Pallone to address California’s concerns.
https://t.co/IjtPQh7951"
California’s landmark privacy laws and the new kids age-appropriate design bill, both of which received unanimous and bipartisan support in both chambers, must continue to protect Californians — and states must be allowed to address rapid changes in technology.
Proudly, California leads the nation not only in innovation, but also in consumer protection.  With so much innovation happening in our state, it is imperative that California continues offering and enforcing the nation’s strongest privacy rights.
However, Governor Newsom, the California Privacy Protection Agency and top state leaders have pointed out the American Data Privacy and Protection Act does not guarantee the same essential consumer protections as California’s existing privacy laws.
The Energy and Commerce Committee is to be commended for its work on federal data privacy legislation.  Importantly, Democrats won the right for consumers for the first time to be able to seek damages in court for violations of their privacy rights.
It was a pleasure to join @RepJoeNeguse at @NCAR_Science for a discussion on how Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act is helping America combat the climate crisis by fueling scientific research and innovation across the country. https://t.co/mUGFRgC6EC
"While @HouseGOP plots a national abortion ban, @HouseDemocrats are defending health freedom.

While they seek to dismantle Social Security &amp; Medicare, we're slashing seniors' health costs.

While they attack Democracy, we're putting #PeopleOverPolitics.

The contrast is clear."
Spearheaded by the @bamhtf, Congress will continue working, on a bipartisan basis, to support all those fighting to overcome addiction: combating stigma, expanding access to care and supporting the caregivers helping them on their journey toward recovery.
"As our nation marks the beginning of #NationalRecoveryMonth, @HouseDemocrats stand with the millions of Americans battling substance use disorders.
 
Exacerbated by the trauma of the pandemic, the fight against addiction is more urgent than ever."

".@HouseDemocrats are working to create good-paying jobs &amp; make more products in America.

Our #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw creates millions of jobs rebuilding America’s roads, bridges &amp; transit systems.

The CHIPS &amp; Science Law brings semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S."
"For decades, Democrats have fought to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.

Our #InflationReductionAct takes a giant step toward this goal: empowering Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs &amp; ensuring seniors don’t pay more than $2000/yr for their medication."
While @HouseGOP and special interests work to keep prices high for families, @HouseDemocrats put #PeopleOverPolitics by taking action to lower drug prices and bring down costs at the grocery store and gas pump, keeping more money in families' pockets.
"Extreme MAGA Republicans only care about power. That’s why they want to:

- Criminalize women’s health care &amp; roll back marriage equality
- End Social Security &amp; Medicare

This week, I joined @RepJimmyGomez at the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator to discuss Democrats’ historic climate action in the #InflationReductionAct. https://t.co/KlPa7rZR4L
"Democrats’ #InflationReductionAct has three parts:

1. Lowering the cost of health care
2. Delivering the historic climate action
3. Dramatically reducing the deficit.

And it’s all fully paid for simply by asking the ultra-rich and big corporations to pay their fair share."
"We are committed to defending women’s rights, freedoms and rightful place at the decision-making table.
 
Because we know this truth: when women succeed, America succeeds.
 
Read my full statement on Women’s Equality Day: https://t.co/21nUYwJzrA"
Today, @HouseDemocrats are mobilizing for a Day of Action across the nation: a growing drumbeat of fierce opposition to these right-wing attacks. While Republicans seek to turn back the clock for women, House Democrats will never relent in our fight to put #PeopleOverPolitics.
Unwavering in our commitment to reproductive justice, the Democratic House has passed landmark legislation to enshrine the protections of Roe v. Wade into law, establish a federal right to use birth control and reaffirm Americans’ right to access health care across state lines.
"As we celebrate this triumph in our history, women’s most basic rights and dignities remain under assault.
 
In the wake of the heart-wrenching Dobbs decision, Republicans have waged a dark crusade of punishment and control – even seeking to impose a national abortion ban."
Today, American women proudly carry on the spirit of the heroes who came before us: marching in the streets, organizing in our communities and legislating in the halls of power.
Too often unsung in the American story, courageous women of color continued advancing that struggle for decades after – moving us ever closer to realizing our founding promise of liberty and justice for all.
In winning the right to vote more than a century ago, trailblazing suffragists tore down a seemingly immovable barrier to women’s full and equal citizenship in our Democracy.
Today, the American people mark the 102nd anniversary of the 19th Amendment: a hard-won victory secured by generations of women bravely fighting to build a more perfect union. https://t.co/QImSYfHmzI
"Our #AmericanRescuePlan powered unprecedented job growth with 9.4 million jobs since January 2021.

"Make no mistake: the #InflationReductionAct is fully paid for by ensuring the wealthiest few and biggest corporations pay their fair share.
 
And there are no new taxes on families making $400,000 or less or on small businesses."
"Meanwhile, the #InflationReductionAct helps fight inflation for families in the long-term.

Making an historic investment in paying down the deficit by $300 billion this decade and $2 trillion over two decades will help cool inflation for years to come."

Today, tens of millions of Americans rely on their hard-earned Social Security checks to get by each month. Rather than safeguarding and strengthening these essential benefits, extreme MAGA Republicans are seeking to destroy Social Security as we know it.
For generations, Social Security has been a pillar of financial stability: bringing peace of mind to those in retirement, living with a disability or grieving a loved one. Yet, Republicans are continuing their extreme efforts to unwind this transformative legislative achievement.
Nearly nine decades ago, amid the turmoil and hardship of the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act – ensuring that, after a lifetime of hard work, seniors could enjoy the dignity of a secure retirement.

Democrats are focused on putting #PeopleOverPolitics: protecting the health and lives of those who fought to protect us. We are deeply grateful for the persistent mobilization of veterans, military families and caregivers across the country who never lost hope in this fight.
Democrats have always sought to find bipartisan common ground in service of our veterans, and it is a profound disappointment that Senate Republicans chose to play partisan games with the well-being of sick war heroes.
The PACT Act secures access to life-saving care for millions of veterans exposed to deadly toxins in the line of duty, as well as empowering those harmed at Camp Lejeune to have their day in court.
Today, Democrats took a monumental step toward fully honoring the sacrifice of our heroes in uniform. Thanks to @RepMarkTakano, @SenatorTester, veterans and veterans’ champions, the Honoring our PACT Act has overcome Republican obstruction and will soon be the law of the land.

This agreement would reduce the deficit and help fight inflation by allocating an historic $300 billion for deficit reduction. It is also fully paid for by implementing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax and strengthening IRS enforcement.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reduces the cost of health care for millions, allows Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs, reduces carbon pollution by roughly 40 percent by 2030, lowers energy costs and advances energy security.

This action will take steps to uphold a woman’s right to make her own health decisions: protecting access to FDA-approved medication abortion, strengthening enforcement of the Affordable Care Act’s contraceptive protections and defending the legal rights of patients &amp; providers.
.@POTUS’ executive order today helps advance Democrats’ fight to defend Americans’ health freedom from all-out assault by right-wing extremists.
While Republicans seek to rip away health care, raise middle class taxes and keep everyday prices sky-high, Democrats are fighting to lower kitchen table costs, create more jobs and deliver bigger paychecks. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/fOnAd16ZPI
At the same time, we must lower the outrageous cost of prescription drugs while also bolstering American competitiveness with new investments to make more goods in America and rebuild our STEM workforce.
By cracking down on exorbitant shipping fees with our #OceanShippingReformAct, the House acted to level the playing field for American businesses and lower costs for American consumers.
"@HouseDemocrats are waging an all-out fight against global inflation fueled by Putin’s Price Hike, which is weighing on families at home.
 
The House-passed #LowerFoodAndFuelCostsAct slashes costs for farmers, bolsters industry competition &amp; expands access to homegrown biofuels."
Today, our nation has also reached an important milestone: under the leadership of @POTUS Biden and our Democratic Majorities in Congress, we have recovered the total number of private sector jobs lost since the beginning of the pandemic.
"June’s jobs report shows that, after creating 9 million jobs in just 17 months, America continues its strong, steady jobs growth.
 
Democrats are working to fight inflation, lower kitchen table costs, create more jobs &amp; deliver bigger paychecks #ForThePeople."
In his memory, let us renew our pledge to carry on his commitment to peace, to advance our shared security interests and to strengthen the alliance between our nations, now and for generations to come. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/HHhUl8QBNE
May it be a comfort to Prime Minister Abe’s wife, Akie, to their family and to the people of Japan that so many in America and across the globe pray with them during this terrible time.
"It was a special privilege for Members of Congress when Prime Minister Abe delivered an address to a Joint Session of Congress in 2015. 
 
I was deeply honored to receive the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun from Emperor Akihito, in the presence of Prime Minister Abe."
Congress &amp; our Country join the people of Japan in mourning the sad loss of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Over his long tenure in public service, PM Abe was an historic leader, a valued friend to America, &amp; a champion of peace &amp; prosperity – for Japan &amp; for the entire world.
"The cruel &amp; outrageous ruling by the Republican-controlled Supreme Court has achieved the GOP's dark &amp; extreme goal of ripping away women's right to make their own reproductive health decisions.

Democrats are fighting for the rights of women &amp; all Americans."
Today, and every day, the Congress remains unwavering in our bipartisan, bicameral gratitude for His Holiness’ inspiring leadership, and we continue to stand with him in the struggle for true religious, linguistic and cultural freedom in Tibet.

"High prices of fertilizer can hurt farmers in the field and families on the shelf. 

With our Lower Food &amp; Fuel Costs Act, @HouseDemocrats are working to lower fertilizer costs for farmers and lowering prices on the shelf for American families."
"While #PutinsPriceHike and supply chain shortages fuel inflation, @HouseDemocrats passed the Lower Food &amp; Fuel Costs Act.

This bill is Democrats' latest step to bring down crucial kitchen table costs – at the gas pump and in the grocery store."
As we mark Independence Day today, let us renew our vow to never relent until all our children can live free from the fear of gun violence.
"Americans’ hearts are broken by the senseless gun violence in Highland Park today, as innocent families were celebrating this all-American holiday.

We pray for all those who have lost loved ones and for the entire community forever scarred by this shooting."
"That means we must always participate in the proud American tradition of expanding freedom, rather than restricting rights.
 
Best wishes to you and your loved ones for a peaceful and patriotic 4th of July.

As we mark this all-American holiday, our #IndependenceDay, let us never forget our duty to honor the glorious vision of our Founders: a nation where all may enjoy the blessings of liberty, bestowed by the Constitution and secured by our heroes in uniform.
On the #4thOfJuly, our nation celebrates the profound vision and courage of our Founders: who, nearly two and a half centuries ago, launched an unprecedented experiment in Democracy. https://t.co/EvRCSHFPMq
"Republicans are working to drag our nation back to a dark past — with extreme measures to ban abortion, criminalize contraception, in vitro fertilization &amp; post-miscarriage care.

Democrats will never give up in the fight against Republicans' anti-women, anti-freedom extremism."

Right-wing extremists – backed by their radical Republican supermajority on the Supreme Court – are now waging an all-out assault on even more of our freedoms, from reproductive health rights to marriage equality.
The Democratic House has passed the For The People Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to crack down on bigoted voter suppression, and we proudly advanced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to save lives from racist police violence.
.@HouseDemocrats are fighting alongside tireless activists to stamp out bigotry and defend the freedom of every American. With our twice-passed Equality Act, we voted to further bolster the legacy of the Civil Rights Act by extending its full protections to LGBTQ Americans.
As our nation commemorates this proud milestone in the American story, our basic rights &amp; dignities remain under urgent threat from the forces of hate. Amid celebrations of our most cherished freedoms this Independence Day, we must renew our resolve to forge a more perfect union.
Nearly six decades ago, the courage &amp; sacrifice of countless civil rights heroes gave rise to the landmark Civil Rights Act. This transformative legislation stands as a pillar of our Democracy, helping move our nation closer to our founding promise of liberty &amp; justice for all. https://t.co/kwaKTKosjN
While this extremist Supreme Court works to punish and control the American people, Democrats must continue our fight to expand freedom in America. Read my Dear Colleague on @HouseDemocrats legislative response here: https://t.co/glA1DwuTp4
"We know this is only the start for the Radical Republican Party, as they aim at everything from access to contraception &amp; in-vitro fertilization to marriage equality. 
 
Democrats are introducing bills to codify freedoms that Americans currently enjoy."
And we must again pass the Women’s Health Protection Act: landmark legislation to enshrine Roe v. Wade into the law of the land.
We must also make clear that Americans have the Constitutional right to travel freely and voluntarily throughout the United States.
We must protect women’s most intimate and personal data stored in reproductive health apps. Many fear that this information could be used against women by a sinister prosecutor in a state that criminalizes abortion.
"As @POTUS said yesterday, we must codify Roe into law. This means the Senate must eliminate the filibuster to restore women’s fundamental rights. 
 
At the same time, here’s a thread of some of the legislative action Democrats are exploring to protect women’s health &amp; freedom:"
"A woman's fundamental health decisions are her own to make, not to be dictated by far-right politicians.
 
While extremist Republicans are working to punish and control women, Democrats are fighting ferociously to enshrine Roe v Wade into law."
"It was my pleasure to meet again with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Vatican.

"Today’s ruling by a radical, pro-pollution Supreme Court strikes a severe blow to the @EPA’s authority to do its duty: to protect the environment.
 
In doing so, the Court has bowed to polluters who seek to poison the air our children breathe &amp; the water they drink with impunity."
Congress and the Country are also deeply grateful to Justice Stephen Breyer – a leader of integrity, a champion of liberty and a jurist who never wavered in his sacred duty to defend Americans' individual rights.
"As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson takes her seat on the Supreme Court, our nation takes an historic step toward realizing our highest ideals.
 
Amid this Court's cruel assault on Americans' health, freedom and security, she will be a much needed force for equal justice for all."

In the course of our discussion, we also talked about climate, as it relates to saving the planet, reducing dependence on Russian oil and gas, and diversification to do both.
We agreed on the importance of tackling rising costs stemming from the Russian invasion, as well as ensuring economic security on both sides of the Atlantic. I reiterated America’s appreciation for Italy hosting 30,000 American troops and their families.
We reaffirmed our countries’ commitments to supporting the people of Ukraine as they courageously fight back against Putin’s unlawful aggression, including by strengthening NATO and the G7.

With our twice-passed #EqualityAct, the Democratic House proudly voted to extend the full protections of the Civil Rights Act to LGBTQ Americans and root out hateful discrimination wherever it appears — from employment and education to housing and health care.
".@HouseDemocrats are committed to standing against this ruthless assault on the rights of millions of LGBTQ Americans.  

And as we fight to defend marriage equality, we remain committed to advancing justice in every part of American life."
In the wake of the Supreme Court’s outrageous and heart-wrenching decision overturning Roe v. Wade, radical Republicans have made clear that they are setting their sights on other rulings rooted in the Constitutional right to privacy — including Obergefell.
Yet this fundamental right has come under grave threat as right-wing extremists seek to undermine legal precedent, unwind hard-fought progress and strip away basic freedoms.
Today, Americans commemorate a landmark victory for equal justice under the law. By unequivocally recognizing the Constitutional right to marriage equality, the Obergefell v. Hodges decision continues to bring joy, dignity and justice to families in every corner of the country.
"Over the last few days, the Supreme Court inflicted devastation on our nation. We must and will keep up the fight for health, safety &amp; freedom — for women, their families &amp; every American.

As right-wing extremists continue their vicious campaign of disenfranchisement, Democrats will not rest until we ensure that every American has a say in the destiny of our Democracy.
Last year, driven by the inspiring legacy of its namesake, we advanced the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to revitalize the VRA and restore its urgently needed voter protections.
House Democrats have proudly fought alongside relentless advocates to reverse these sinister attacks.  The Democratic House has twice passed our For The People Act to restore a government of, by and for the people.
Nearly a decade later, this ruling continues to undermine the cornerstone of our Democracy, allowing malicious forces to chip away at Americans’ sacred right to vote and silence people of color across the country.
By gutting the heart of the Voting Rights Act, a Republican-appointed Court opened the floodgates to rampant voter suppression, partisan gerrymandering and a surge of dark money in our elections.
Nine years ago today, the Supreme Court dealt a grave blow to American Democracy with its disastrous ruling in Shelby v. Holder.
The Congress proudly sends to @POTUS a bipartisan bill to continue providing our children with healthy, free school meals. This is a victory #ForTheChildren and provides the foundation they need to succeed – both in the classroom and for the rest of their lives. https://t.co/aDsFoC4hgc

A woman’s fundamental health decisions are her own to make, in consultation with her doctor &amp; her loved ones – not to be dictated by far-right politicians. While Republicans seek to punish &amp; control women, Democrats will keep fighting ferociously to enshrine Roe v. Wade into law.
In Congress, Republicans are plotting a nationwide abortion ban. In the states, they want to arrest doctors offering reproductive care &amp; women for terminating a pregnancy. GOP extremists are threatening to criminalize contraception, in-vitro fertilization &amp; post-miscarriage care.
Because of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Party &amp; their supermajority on the Supreme Court, American women today have less freedom than their mothers. Radical Republicans are now charging ahead with their crusade to criminalize health freedom.
Today, the Republican-controlled Supreme Court has achieved the GOP’s dark and extreme goal of ripping away women’s right to make their own reproductive health decisions.
This morning, the Rules Committee is meeting to advance this life-saving legislation to the Floor. When the Committee finishes its business, we will head immediately to the Floor. And we will send the bill to @POTUS for his signature, with gratitude for his leadership.
Every day, gun violence steals lives and scars communities — and this crisis demands urgent action. While we must do more, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a step forward that will help protect our children and save lives.
On behalf of the House, we applaud the Senate for passing its gun violence prevention package on a strong bipartisan vote.

This historic achievement has provided a springboard for women to succeed in and out of the classroom: empowering so many to pursue their dreams of becoming doctors and engineers, heads of businesses and non-profits, and even pioneering public servants.
With the help of her sheer force of will, Congresswoman Mink led the charge alongside Congresswoman Edith Green and Senator Birch Bayh to craft and enact this landmark legislation – advancing a brighter, fairer future for women and girls. https://t.co/DE7MmBrfgq

https://t.co/z7vOtrJ2ft"
In the words of Congressman John Lewis, the Conscience of the Congress: ‘Ours is the struggle of a lifetime, or maybe even many lifetimes, and each one of us in every generation must do our part.’
These actions alone cannot right the painful wrongs of our history, but they can move us closer to forging a more perfect union.
Guided by President Biden’s vision, we placed justice at the heart of our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – delivering historic investments to clean up the legacy pollution and unsafe drinking water that continue to disproportionately harm communities of color.
House Democrats have led the charge to restore the foundation of our democracy and uphold Americans’ sacred right to vote through our For The People Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.
Inspired by the millions who have peacefully taken to the streets bearing witness to the truth that Black Lives Matter, we are fighting to root out the systemic bigotry that still plagues our nation, including through the House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
Last year, the Congress took bipartisan, bicameral action to consecrate Juneteenth as a federal holiday. House Democrats know that this recognition must also come with transformative action.
As we commemorate the emancipation of enslaved African Americans in Galveston 157 years ago, we remember the generations of heroic civil rights leaders who have advanced the ongoing struggle to realize America’s highest ideals of justice, equality and opportunity for all.
Juneteenth is both a celebration of freedom and a moment to reflect on the horrendous injustice that has stained the soul of our nation. https://t.co/aZ7boH3H35

America’s epidemic of gun violence has reached a fever pitch — and Democrats will never stop working to end the bloodshed.
Importantly, the Senate has also advanced a House-passed measure to combat straw purchases, to keep firearms out of the hands of those who cannot legally purchase them themselves.
Included in the Senate framework are House Democrats’ proposals to incentivize states to establish extreme risk protection order laws and get guns out of the hands of those who pose a danger to themselves or others.
"Today is a step forward For The Children, as the Senate has reached bipartisan agreement on gun violence prevention for the first time in three decades.

While more is needed, this package will take steps to save lives."
House Democrats remain committed to getting common-sense gun violence prevention legislation across the finish line, and we will not rest until the job is done. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/RStyVt7xiC
Shortly after the attack at Pulse, it was my sad privilege to visit with survivors in Orlando. They shared a simple, urgent plea: that our nation’s leaders honor the memory of their loved ones not with empty words, but with action.
Last year, the Congress proudly and solemnly voted to honor these 49 beautiful souls by immortalizing Pulse as a national memorial. And now, we are fighting to protect communities from the scourge of hate-fueled terror and prevent such a tragedy from ever happening again.
Six years ago, a horrifying act of mass murder at Pulse Nightclub stole away 49 lives, injured more than 50 others and left countless loved ones shattered. This hateful act devastated a sanctuary of safety and solidarity for Orlando’s LGBTQ community.

https://t.co/RMtWacAecZ"
In 1944, as women helped power America’s economy through World War II, Congresswoman Winifred Stanley introduced one of our nation’s first equal pay proposals. She argued: ‘This battered old universe needs and will need the best brains and ability of both men and women.’
"Closing the gender pay gap is both a moral and economic imperative.
 
That is why @HouseDemocrats are leading the charge to remove barriers to prosperity – twice passing Chair @RosaDeLauro's Paycheck Fairness Act to strengthen and modernize the Equal Pay Act."
However, with women still receiving 83 cents for every dollar made by their male colleagues – a gap that is even wider for women of color – we also recognize that the fight for gender equality remains as urgent as ever.
Nearly six decades ago, President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, enshrining the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’ into federal law. Today, Americans proudly commemorate this momentous step forward in the fight for workplace justice.
Last night, it was my honor to bring greetings from the U.S. Congress to the foreign ministers of the Western Hemisphere &amp; welcome them to the Golden State!

We must never be silent on issues of freedom, dignity and democracy – because if we do not speak out against human rights abuses in China due to commercial interests, then we will lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anywhere else in the world.
As we commemorate the heroism of the Tiananmen generation, each of us has a sacred obligation to build a more just, more equal and more democratic future.
As the world honors the courage of students, workers and ordinary citizens who peacefully defied the Chinese Communist Party’s oppressive regime, let us renew our vow to keep alive the flame of freedom that burned in their hearts.
Today, the image of a lone figure – unyielding before a line of tanks – remains seared in the memory of all democracy-loving people.
Thirty-three years ago, brave Chinese demonstrators inspired the world through one of the greatest acts of political courage in modern times as they stood up for their rights and freedoms in Tiananmen Square.

Our Majority is also advancing legislation to lower food costs in the grocery aisle by lowering input costs for farmers and cracking down on unfair practices by meatpacking conglomerates that hurt ranchers and consumers alike.
At the same time, Democrats are hard at work to bring down costs for families.  With our gas price gouging legislation, House Democrats voted to end Big Oil’s war profiteering and lower costs at the pump.
With the help of our Rescue Plan, our nation has created more than eight million new jobs under the Biden Administration and slashed unemployment to nearly its pre-pandemic low.

Por demasiado tiempo, algunos miembros del Congreso han ofrecido palabras huecas después de los tiroteos mientras se oponen a todos los esfuerzos para salvar vidas.
Llevamos en el corazón a todos los que han perdido a un ser querido a causa de la violencia armada, ya que este horrible crimen agrava su sufrimiento. Estamos unidos en nuestra profunda gratitud por los héroes que arriesgaron sus vidas para responder a este mortal tiroteo masivo.
Este tiroteo le robó el futuro a estos niños, que nunca vivirán la alegría de graduarse de la escuela, tener una carrera, enamorarse, e incluso formar su propia familia.
Con el corazón roto, los estadounidenses rezan por las familias que han quedado eternamente destrozadas y por una comunidad que ha quedado marcada para siempre.

We are united in our deep gratitude for the heroes who put their lives on the line to respond to this deadly mass shooting.
This shooting stole the futures of children, who won't experience joys of graduating from school, chasing a career, falling in love, even starting a family of their own. We hold close all who have lost a loved one to gun violence, as this horrible crime deepens their suffering.

The Good Friday Accords are the bedrock of peace in Northern Ireland and a beacon of hope for the world. Ensuring there is no physical border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland is necessary for upholding this landmark agreement, which transformed Northern Ireland.
