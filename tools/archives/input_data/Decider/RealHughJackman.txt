@mang0ld That, right there, is @mang0ld ... the epic storyteller I mentioned earlier.
@mang0ld @ComicBook When @mang0ld came up w the character of Laura, and that the movie was in essence about family we were worried about finding the right fit. Until we met @DafneKeen. The first day we auditioned her ... she punched me in the arm so hard, I was literally bruised the next day. Hired.
@mang0ld @ComicBook I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre all getting to see what I‚Äôve known for years. @mang0ld is not only a brilliant director but one of the great storytellers of our time.
@Keurig @SeriousPuzzles @laughingmanco Together we can make this happen ... I hope!!!
To my follow coffee lovers. Please join me in Tweeting @SeriousPuzzles to help convince them to include @laughingmanco in their 2021 edition. PS Also, if you happen to have my missing piece, I‚Äôd love to grab that off you. Thank you. https://t.co/kWPCXHFes9
