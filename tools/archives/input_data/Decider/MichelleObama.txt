What‚Äôs something that you‚Äôve picked up as a hobby or practice that has helped you during these last few years? Reply with your thoughts or tag me in your post using #TheLightWeCarry.
During the peak of the pandemic, when everything felt so bleak, the act of stitching, purling, casting on and off is how I kept my anxiety at bay. Practicing it roots me in this idea that I talk about in my book, The Light We Carry called ‚Äúthe power of small.‚Äù üß∂
Every time I tell people how much I love to knit, they seem so surprised! But it truly has become one of my most meaningful (and fun) pastimes. For me, knitting is a release. It lets my hands lead the way as my mind trails behind. #TheLightWeCarry https://t.co/xkFwib6qox

Because even when the world feels dark and uncertain, we always have the ability to kindle our own light by looking inside ourselves and then sharing it with others. #TheLightWeCarry ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/IZWLMRHrcD
Some of these tools are habits. Some are actual physical objects. Others are attitudes and beliefs from my ongoing journey of becoming. I poured a lot into this book, and my hope is that it might give you some ideas for your own journey.
That‚Äôs when I began the writing process. I think of #TheLightWeCarry as a toolbox of sorts. It‚Äôs a collection of practices and perspectives that I draw on when I need to stay balanced and confident, especially in times of anxiety and stress.
And then, the pandemic hit, leaving us isolated at home during a time of uncertainty. And like everyone else, I had a lot of questions about how to overcome anxiety and fear when it felt like the ground was moving beneath us‚Äîand I heard those questions from so many of you, too.
Four years ago, when I released my memoir, Becoming, I traveled across the country and around the world, meeting so many incredible people‚Äîincluding many of you. It was a little scary to share so much of my story for the first time, but I was so moved by your response. https://t.co/RUDCs1cEKe

I‚Äôll miss her dearly, but I smile knowing how many people she inspired, just like me, to walk a little taller, speak a little more freely, and live a little bit more like God intended.
She was the personification of beauty, grace, wisdom, and strength, carrying forward a flame that not only guided her for 96 pathbreaking years but lit the way for so many of us.
What struck me every time I spent time with Cicely Tyson was not necessarily her star power‚Äîthough that was evident enough‚Äîit was her humanity. Just by walking into a room, she had this way of elevating everyone around her. https://t.co/o6VAV63wqd

Because in America, everyone‚Äôs voice matters. And that‚Äôs still the truth, no matter what some folks want you to believe.
If you live in Georgia, make sure you vote for @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff in tomorrow‚Äôs U.S. Senate runoffs‚Äîand make sure everybody you know does the same. If you‚Äôve already received a mail-in ballot, take it to a drop-box or vote in person at your polling place tomorrow.
So if Georgians elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff, we‚Äôll take another step toward cleaning up the mess of the past four years. And we‚Äôll send a message to any politician who puts themselves and their ambition above our system of self-government.
These runoffs will decide whether President-Elect Biden has a Senate that will work with him rather than just obstruct him at every turn.
Tomorrow‚Äôs runoffs in Georgia will decide whether the U.S. Senate is run by those who‚Äôve shown their willingness to tear down our democracy‚Äîor whether it‚Äôll be run by those who will actually get to work on the monumental challenges before us.
This is why we can‚Äôt just vote for President and think that our job is done.
And this is just unconscionable at a time when a staggering number of Americans are dying every day from a virus that was downplayed for far too long. It‚Äôs unconscionable to focus on overturning an election rather than helping struggling families or distributing a vaccine.
Your vote is your voice. It‚Äôs your power. And right now, from the President of the United States on down, we‚Äôre seeing and hearing just how desperate some are to take that power away. They want us to believe that their pride is more important than our democracy.
"Tomorrow‚Äôs the last day to vote in the Georgia runoffs for the U.S. Senate and it couldn‚Äôt be more important that you make your voice heard.

My warmest congratulations again to Joe and Jill, Kamala and Doug‚Äîand each of you who stepped up when your country needed you.
We‚Äôve got to promise each other that our focus in this election won‚Äôt be an anomaly, but the rule. That‚Äôs how we can not only feel this way right now, but in the months and years ahead. It‚Äôs the only way we‚Äôll build a nation worthy of our children.
So it‚Äôs up to us to stay engaged and informed, to keep speaking out and marching on. We‚Äôve got to vote in even greater numbers in the upcoming Senate runoffs in Georgia‚Äîand every state and local election going forward.
We see now the reality that we can‚Äôt take even the tiniest part of our democracy for granted. Every single vote must count ‚Äî and every single one of us must vote. And as a country, we should be making it easier, not harder to cast a ballot.
But we‚Äôve also got to recognize that the path to progress will always be uphill. We‚Äôll always have to scrape and crawl up toward that mountaintop. And two years from now, four years from now, there will once again be no margin for error.
Let‚Äôs remember that tens of millions of people voted for the status quo, even when it meant supporting lies, hate, chaos, and division. We‚Äôve got a lot of work to do to reach out to these folks in the years ahead and connect with them on what unites us.
And after we celebrate ‚Äî and we should all take a moment to exhale after everything we‚Äôve been through ‚Äî let‚Äôs remember that this is just a beginning. It‚Äôs a first step. Voting in one election isn‚Äôt a magic wand, and neither is winning one.
Thank you to all of you who poured every ounce of your hope and determination into this democracy over these past four years, registering voters, getting them to the polls, keeping folks informed. More votes were cast in this election than ever before. It‚Äôs because of you.
I‚Äôm beyond thrilled that my friend @JoeBiden and our first Black and Indian-American woman Vice President, @KamalaHarris, are headed to restore some dignity, competence, and heart at the White House. Our country sorely needs it. https://t.co/yXqQ3tYRoa

I grew up just a few miles away from where Pastor Tracey Lee is doing such incredible work. During a summer of heartbreaking loss, she's shown up day-in, day-out with faith and love, courage and compassion, and an unshakable belief in young people's right to safety. https://t.co/CTL4dzntQ5

#ImVotingFor the fundamental decency of Americans to be reflected in the Oval Office. I'm voting for competence over chaos, for unity over division. I'm voting for @JoeBiden because he can bring people together to make our country a whole lot better. https://t.co/oV9sJg8Yvj
Getting an education past high school is still the best investment you can make for your future. I'm so proud that @CommonApp made taking that step a little bit easier for young people, especially for students of color, by removing the school discipline question. #ReachHigher https://t.co/58eLovfgqV
And more than anything, I hope you‚Äôll vote for Joe with power, with passion, and with a love of this country that cannot possibly be denied.
So I hope you‚Äôll watch, and I hope you‚Äôll share this with everyone you know who might still be deciding how or if they‚Äôre going to vote.
There‚Äôs only one way we can pull ourselves out‚Äîby voting for my friend @JoeBiden, who‚Äôs got the heart, the experience, and the character to lead us to better days.
Because the drama of the past few days has only emphasized what‚Äôs at stake in this election, from the coronavirus to a constant drumbeat of fear, division, and chaos that‚Äôs threatening to spiral out of control.
And I‚Äôll be very honest: This is a message I‚Äôd planned to release earlier, and after everything that‚Äôs happened, I weighed whether or not to go public at all. But I wanted you all to hear what‚Äôs been on my mind.
The truth is, the events of the past few days are a bracing reminder of the tragedy that has been this administration‚Äôs response to this crisis.
My heart goes out to everyone touched by this virus, from those at the White House, especially the Secret Service and residence staff whose service ought never be taken for granted, to all those names and stories most of us will unfortunately never know. https://t.co/dtEUrcjPAy
There are remarkable organizations all over the world working to ensure girls keep learning safely during the pandemic. As we gear up for the International #DayoftheGirl this week, I hope you‚Äôll support this critical work through the @GirlsAlliance: https://t.co/uAJh9LbSW0.

Rachael asked me what‚Äôs keeping me up at night, and here‚Äôs what I told her: It‚Äôs the idea that after all the fear and division and chaos, this president could still get four more years. The choice couldn‚Äôt be clearer‚Äì‚Äìwe've got to vote for @JoeBiden like our lives depend on it. https://t.co/y0qYHE0iAV
Look, I understand why people are cynical right now. I talked with Conan about what it feels like to be a mother and a person of color in this moment‚Äîand how if we want to hope for some change on any of the issues we care about, then we've got to vote for @JoeBiden. https://t.co/A6WTNqH038
Make sure they know how and when they‚Äôre going to vote. And then follow up with them, every day, to make sure they cast their ballot. Because in this election, we‚Äôve got to vote for Joe in numbers that cannot be denied. https://t.co/vS12U5kabm
It‚Äôs the only way we can get out of this chaos and restore some stability to this country. You can start by reaching out to everyone you know. Make sure they‚Äôre registered.
If you were turned off by the President‚Äôs behavior last night, I feel you. Believe me, I do. But we can‚Äôt let him win by tuning out altogether. That‚Äôs what he wants. So turn those feelings into action‚Äîturn them into votes for my friend, @JoeBiden. https://t.co/cMKoxiNWVZ

This is how you can finish the work that the generations before you started. By staying open and hopeful, even through tough times. Even through discomfort and pain. Channel your feelings into activism and into this democracy that was designed to respond to those who vote.
Text everybody you know to join you in exercising their constitutional right to protest. Send all your friends a link to register to vote at https://t.co/vhWl2PM2ly. And show up to vote in every election.
So if you‚Äôre spending a lot of time hashtagging and posting right now, that‚Äôs useful, especially during a pandemic. But it‚Äôs only a beginning. Go further.
And if you hold strong with the same faith that carried all those giants before you toward real, measurable progress‚Äîyou will change the course of history.
"Dr. King was angry. Sojourner Truth was angry. Lucretia Mott, Cesar Chavez, the folks at Stonewall‚Äîthey were all angry.

But they were also driven by compassion, by principle‚Äîby hope."
"To anyone who‚Äôs feeling invisible: Know that your story matters. Your ideas, your experiences, your vision for our world all matter.

Your anger‚Äîthat matters too. But left on its own, it will only corrode, destroy, and sow chaos‚Äîon the inside and out."
So much has changed so quickly. And if any of you are confused or scared or angry‚Äîor just plain overwhelmed‚ÄîI just want you to know that you aren‚Äôt alone. I am feeling all that, too. And I have a few things I want to say about it. https://t.co/kUZeBzC8xP https://t.co/0zOQpEcX9K
As @aliciakeys communicates so beautifully here, like so many of you, I‚Äôve been doing a lot of thinking over the past few weeks.

It ends with justice, compassion, and empathy that manifests in our lives and on our streets. I pray we all have the strength for that journey, just as I pray for the souls and the families of those who were taken from us.
It‚Äôs up to all of us‚ÄîBlack, white, everyone‚Äîno matter how well-meaning we think we might be, to do the honest, uncomfortable work of rooting it out. It starts with self-examination and listening to those whose lives are different from our own.
Race and racism is a reality that so many of us grow up learning to just deal with. But if we ever hope to move past it, it can‚Äôt just be on people of color to deal with it.
Like so many of you, I‚Äôm pained by these recent tragedies. And I‚Äôm exhausted by a heartbreak that never seems to stop. Right now it‚Äôs George, Breonna, and Ahmaud. Before that it was Eric, Sandra, and Michael. It just goes on, and on, and on. https://t.co/lFWEtTzVT8
