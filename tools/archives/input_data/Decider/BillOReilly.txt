Big winner last night Ron DeSantis.  Loser Nancy Pelosi.  What happened to the Red Wave?  Please read the Message of the Day on https://t.co/rryWmyXLXa. https://t.co/FrMiPkuHzh
No red wave. Republicans should take House but by less than projected.  Senate hinges on Georgia and Nevada.  Must win there. Arizona may go Dem.  Best analysis Wednesday on https://t.co/rryWmyXLXa.
Walker doing well in Georgia. He may make 50 percent which would be an earthquake for country.
No surprises thus far. Republicans sweep Florida. Governor DeSantis gains in power!
Early House returns strong for Republicans.  New Speaker McCarthy has finished his victory speech.  Look for it around 11 eastern time.  No sign of Nancy Pelosi.
CNN exit polling says 52% of voters believe the Democratic Party is too extreme. If you take Dem strongholds like California, New York, Illinois out of that  - the number would rise to about 70%.
"Trump says DeSantis could be more ‘gracious’, claims DeSantis owes him everything. It’ll be interesting to see how this plays out. I’ll be on @NewsNation giving my Midterm analysis at 9pm, plus watch the full Trump interview exclusively on NewsNation. #ad

The truth about Chris Cuomo.  Please read the Message of the Day on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C. https://t.co/WsW5OtoQHY
"When Governor Andrew Cuomo began to get accused of a variety of things, Chris Cuomo should have recused himself from covering the story.  That's journalistic ethics 101.

The fact that CNN did not insist on the recusal tells you all you need to know about that corrupt operation."
"A new Covid variant has emerged, and the media believes panic is the best medicine.
