Alright! It's MONDAY!! So put on your headphones cause my 1st song for#millasmusicmondays is a gorgeous one!
Anyway,thanks for all your suggestions, but I haven't heard it yet.I wouldn't ordinarily post this song, but this version kind of killed me.
Hey guys! I really appreciate you'r help w with this.It's drake singing the song, not a girl. And in the chorus, everything drops an octave.
It was on soundcloud last year... I'm so stupid for not liking it then... But if anyone remembers that version, I would be so grateful.
"Alright, quiz time. Does anyone remember a version of ""hotline bling"" where the chorus goes DOWN an octave?What artist remixed that version?"

@necrophylia being pregnant and having another baby has been a lot of work for the last few years, so i'm trying not to beat myself up!
@necrophylia but i am going to take guitar lessons again this year to re inspire myself and get back into making music.
@necrophylia tbh i have been going through some changes on a personal level and have not been inspired to write recently. Its tough.
@tsalerno0172 I actually wanted to do this as a video chat, but didn't have time to figure out how to do it! have to look into that.
@leigheird yes, Claire is back in this movie because we hadn't seen her since 4 and she is fierce! Her and Alice team up and kick butt!
@AnthonyParrillo but I'm also working on a film adapted from a collection of short stories by George R. R. Martin this year!

i send out a lot of love to my fans and many apologies! all the best! -m
but personal contact with individuals is at an end. its too bad that the rotten apple spoils the bunch, but its the reality.
it makes me feel sad that i have to be distant with you all, as it is not my nature. i have not stopped posting altogether, as was suggested
now that sucks for all the cool people i got to know on here, but my family comes first and i cannot take any chances when it comes to them.
after contacting authorities, i was told to absolutely stop talking to people i don't know on social forums.
A lot of my followers hve been asking why i don't chat on here anymore. unfortunately, my family was threatened last year by a stalker.

"@heidihamilton and then he's all ""well, that's a cute story, but they've kind of moved on from that subject already."" i was crushed. really."
@heidihamilton AND i've tried to call in so many times with stories, but could;t get thu, so i was SO HAPPY 2 actually get a real person...
@heidihamilton of course its only when she's watching a movie in the back seat with headphones on! lol!
@heidihamilton btw, i listen to you m frank EVERY morning on the school run and literally am crying of laughter in the car.
@heidihamilton anytime! i always tell my husband that i want to go to marongo casino at 4am to meet you!
@heidiandfrank just kidding abt firing him... but maybe he should do mystery news to make up for it?
"@heidiandfrank like... ""russian mail order"" when i say that, they put me through, no questions asked."
@heidiandfrank good. he should be! can i get like a secret code when i call and they'll put me through?
@heidiandfrank and it WAS funny. i swear! no matter what the phone dude tells you!
