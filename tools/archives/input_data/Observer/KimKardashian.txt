As for my future with Balenciaga, I am currently re-evaluating my relationship with the brand, basing it off their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with — &amp; the actions I am expecting to see them take to protect children.
I appreciate Balenciaga’s removal of the campaigns and apology. In speaking with them, I believe they understand the seriousness of the issue and will take the necessary measures for this to never happen again.
As a mother of four, I have been shaken by the disturbing images. The safety of children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society — period.
I have been quiet for the past few days, not because I haven’t been disgusted and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns, but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened.

Help us right this wrong and ask PA to take another look at C.J.'s case: https://t.co/s4eZGX7Ga5
C.J. Rice had a defense attorney who only met with him TWICE before trial and failed to present expert testimony that C.J. was physically incapable of committing the crime due to his fractured pelvis and injured abdomen. https://t.co/If3BT3iAFH
"How could an innocent 17-year-old end up behind bars until he's 77 years old? Meet C.J. Rice - despite being a minor, he was tried as an adult and sentenced to 30-60 years behind bars for a crime that his doctor says he could not have committed.

@felipemnzp Chi Chi would actually never!!!
And special thanks to @ScottyBudnick for dedicating your life to helping others and mentoring these kids every free weekend you get. Not only do you allow me to tag along on your journey but I learn so much from you.
I want to thank @LACProbation and the Superintendent for having me and to the staff I met - who really believe in redemption and were constantly guiding these young men towards a positive path. https://t.co/K3jXOnPVGK
These are the young men that deserve a second chance and if we give them the opportunities and tools to learn and grow and change we need to be doing everything we can to help them.
I walked away really understanding that these young adults need our attention and will be out one day and we need to set them up to succeed and not go back to the lifestyle they were so accustomed to. https://t.co/N59CyMkHM7
They were being mentored by the dedicated and committed Probation officers and men from @AntiRecidivism. As these young people are reimagining their lives, it is up for us as a community to reimagine how we meaningfully support them. Youth and young adults can change!!!
They were doing victim impact work with families of crime victims through @HDAHealing and @AYC100. They were learning songwriting and music production from @JailGuitarDoors.
All the boys I met had made the decision to change their lives and were actively living that change. They were in college at @lamcofficial and some were enrolled in the Hollywood CPR program at West LA College to get into the film unions. https://t.co/yOxlaDaIHq
This made me feel so sad and angry but I also was impressed with the accountability they were taking for their lifestyle and crimes they committed.
They were so brave to share their stories with me on their upbringings of abuse, neglect, foster care, and feeling unloved which ultimately led them to make some awful choices that led them to where they are at now in life. https://t.co/HBWGNjkxaT
Last week I had the most educational and inspiring visit to Barry J Nidorf juvenile hall in LA - my first time visiting a juvenile facility. I was really impressed by the young men that I had the opportunity of spending time with. https://t.co/07Vpu4foVP

So far their requests have been denied. I ask the @officialFBOP to grant Eli Torres temporary release so that he can say his last goodbye to his baby girl. Every parent deserves that right.
This is Eliahana ‘Ellie’ Cruz Torres, 10 years old, and one of the 19 victims of the shooting in Uvalde, TX. Her family are desperately hoping that her father, who is incarcerated for a non violent drug offense, be granted temporary release so that he can attend her funeral. https://t.co/RJbSAomyuC

Here is my blog post from 2017, unfortunately it has not aged. 💔 https://t.co/vlqoxIf8rg
I’m urging our leaders to come together and put politics aside and put children first.
Imagine the entire classroom of children who witnessed their friends die in front of them. The trauma will last a lifetime for everyone involved. Words can’t express my heartbreak for the parents whose babies didn’t come home from school yesterday.
We can’t accept it. We can’t have another five years go by without effective, impactful laws put in place to protect our kids. We are parents, we are mothers, we are begging and pleading for action.
We can’t accept this as normal anymore. It’s not normal for a teenager to kill children. It’s not normal for our kids to be practicing active shooter drills in schools. It’s not normal to be shot while shopping for groceries. I’m not numbed by it. I will never be numbed by it.
but if we increase legal age to purchase, coupled with a ban on assault weapons, we can without a doubt reduce the number of senseless tragedies and save children’s lives.
There are of course people over 21 who buy guns to cause harm, and other mass shootings in recent years have been carried out by people over 21,
But the one thing that law makers can and should control now is access to weapons.
There is no question that mental health, racism, deep-seated hatred all play a role in the motivation for mass shootings in recent years. And at a community level, as parents, teachers, there is a lot that can be done to help teens and young adults that isn’t being done.
As I even type these words I am seriously dumbfounded that this is something considered normal, acceptable and legal.
Someone who is not old enough to buy alcohol should not be allowed to purchase a firearm. There is no world in which an 18 year old needs a semi automatic weapon, or any weapon, and no world in which the outcome can be anything other than tragic.
The legal age to purchase a firearm is also a serious issue and needs to be addressed and increased. The Parkland shooter, the Buffalo grocery store shooter, the Texas shooter yesterday, they were all under 21 and reportedly purchased weapons legally. These are teenagers.
Assault weapons didn’t even exist when the Second Amendment was written. We have to stop allowing people to use a sentence written centuries ago when technology, times, humanity were completely different, to dictate how we regulate gun ownership, &amp; how we protect our kids today.
AR-15 style semi automatic rifles were used in Newtown, Parkland, Aurora, San Bernardino, Orlando, Parkland, in the Buffalo shooting 10 days ago, and reportedly in yesterday’s shooting. Assault weapons are not a self defense tool. They are sophisticated weapons, designed to kill.
Semi automatic weapons, assault weapons, weapons of war, should not be legally sold or owned by American civilians. They should be banned. Period.
There is no excuse and no justification for what happened yesterday. The current laws in our country around gun control are not protecting our children. We have to push law makers to enact laws that are fitting in today’s world.
Yesterday 19 children were murdered by an 18 year old, and I find myself heartbroken, disgusted and furious about how little has been done by law makers to enact gun laws that protect our children.
In it I asked “is it more important to protect the second amendment than to protect our own children?”
Five years ago, almost to the day, I wrote an essay for my blog about my thoughts on gun control in honor of National Gun Violence Awareness Day.
I am prepping all my Italy content now! Get ready for the major spam! It won’t take me a week to post it don’t worry lol. I just like to live in the moment sometimes but getting all my posts ready 🇮🇹❤️

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for your loyalty and love these last few years. I cannot wait to introduce you to the next chapter of my fragrance journey—I promise I won’t be gone for too long.
Fragrance as many of you know is deeply personal for me. I put my heart and soul into every bottle, and I’m so incredibly proud of every KKW Fragrance product and collaboration that we have launched since Crystal Gardenia in 2017.
On May 1st at midnight, @KKWFragrance will be shutting down the website so that we can relaunch fragrance in the future under a brand new name—and under a new web store where you can purchase from all beauty categories under one site.

Gov Jared Polis @govofco also announced that he has granted 3 commutations, 15 individual pardons &amp; has signed an Executive Order granting 1,351 pardons for convictions of possession of 2ounces or less of marijuana. Marijuana is legal in Colorado, it’s the right thing to do! 👏🏼
Thank you @GovofCO 🙏🏼👏🏼 https://t.co/v0HoGuafnP
This case was a clear example of why mandatory minimums don’t work and need to be abolished. I’m grateful to Governor Polis for his empathy and leadership on this case.
Thank you @GovofCO for taking action to reduce Mr. Aguilera- Mederos sentence! While his new sentence is ten years, he will now have an opportunity to come home in five years and be with his son and wife.

I pray that Governor Polis, who has been a leader on supporting reforms that increase human dignity in the legal system, will commute his sentence.
And yet, for some reason the prosecutor thought it would be funny to post a photo of a brake shoe trophy she received from a colleague with a plaque? Makes me so sick.
Another shocking part of the case is this post by the prosecutor after his conviction. Four people died in this tragic accident. Rogel has a life sentence for the accident, which will not only destroy his life, but it will also impact his wife and son’s life. https://t.co/xrYSqL2IvM
Colorado law really has to be changed and this is so unfair. @GovofCO is a really good person and I know he will do the right thing.
Another shocking and unfair part of this case is that the judge didn’t want to sentence him to such a lengthy sentence. However, because of the mandatory minimums in Colorado, his hands were tied. Mandatory minimums take away judicial discretion and need to end.
He was not drunk or under the influence, his brakes on the semi tractor-trailer failed.
For those who don’t know about this case, Rogel Aguilera-Mederos is a 26 year old that was sentenced 110 years in prison for driving a semi-tractor-trailer and crashed into traffic killing four people.
I know everyone has been posting about Rogel Aguilera-Mederos this week. I took a deep dive in it to figure out what the situation is. https://t.co/617xtcGOMK

"Thank you so much Governor Stitt for commuting Julius Jones sentence to life without parole and stopping his execution. 

Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to make this happen. It truly took a village."
It’s so nice for people to understand that this isn’t about politics, sometimes this is just about the people. To see everyone from the right and the left come together is a beautiful powerful thing.
I found this chalk drawing of Julius Jones and wanted to share it and to again thank everyone who helped in getting the word out about the injustice in his case. Your voices helped save him from getting executed yesterday. https://t.co/8bqKkXjPle

I am especially worried that Afghanistan is becoming yesterday's news. We must keep awareness alive of all the high-risk individuals, particularly women and girls, at risk of being killed by the Taliban and Islamic State. Let's keep their stories alive and do what we can to help!
We need more countries to open their arms to these people who are living in fear every single day, like the UK graciously did for the 130 girls and their families today.
They are hunting for female journalists, female judges and activists. There are orphanages that are horribly selling their orphans for money. The biggest issue is that these people do not have countries that are welcoming them as refugees.
But the work continues. There are still female sports players in Afghanistan whose lives are at risk. The Taliban beheaded an Afghan volleyball player, Mahjabin Hakimi, who was in her early twenties and at her prime. The Taliban are hunting for players as well as many others.
A big shout out to @Khalida_Popal for leading this effort to save these girls, and to everyone else involved in this incredible mission!
I want to thank @Tzedek_Assoc for their incredible work to help save these girls and so many others at risk of being killed and persecuted in Afghanistan. It's an honor to partner and unite with them in helping to bring this flight to fruition. Thank you for this opportunity!
It's such a privilege to be a part of this life-saving mission to save the Afghan Female Youth National Team! All girls have the right to be whatever they want to be. They are courageous and it's tragic they had to flee their country because they wish to play a sport they love. https://t.co/s9nAD588lg
"I’m so grateful to everyone who used their voice and helped to save Julius’s life today.

Thank you to the parole board and Governor Stitt. 🙏🏼❤️"
He said if you are doing something your mom wouldn’t approve of then you shouldn’t be doing it. It’s that simple!
He also wanted me to pass a few messages along that were really important to him. The most important is that you have to always make sure you are doing the right thing. Julius was hanging out with the wrong crowd and that landed him in the position he’s in today.
However Julius refused because he said he has a clear conscience and that gives him peace knowing he is innocent and did not want to be drugged up.
While I was on the phone with him somebody came in the room to try to give him his anti-anxiety meds that you usually are forced to take before you are executed so that you can be more calm about the fact that you are about to be executed.
I spent most of my day on the phone with Julius yesterday in between his lawyer meetings and family visitation which still are not contact visits. Meaning he cannot still hug his family members before being executed. He hasn’t in over 20 years.
Thank you so much Governor Stitt for commuting Julius Jones sentence to life without parole and stopping his execution today.
This is the cold machinery of the Death Penalty in America. In just over two weeks, an innocent man could be put to death. My heart breaks for Julius and so many others who have suffered from such tragic miscarriage of justice.
At 9pm the day before his execution, #JuliusJones phone privileges will be terminated and he will receive his last meal. He will be checked on every 15 minutes for the last four hours of his life. Then, he will be put to death.
On Thursday, the Inspector General will obtain the body bag and tag from the medical examiner’s office and all witnesses for the execution will be selected. Next week, they will restrict access to the unit where Julius is housed and they will perform equipment checks.
Like all incarcerated people put to death by the Oklahoma Dept of Corrections, #JuliusJones organs are not eligible for donation. The staff who will administer his execution are being selected and trained to put him to his death.
The state is so bent on vengeance that they will make every effort to ensure they get to kill Julius- including reviving him if he happens to go into cardiac arrest prior to the execution. https://t.co/cyXLGhoEmt
Julius is being closely monitored by staff - every meal he has and every liquid he consumes is logged. His personal property has been catalogued and he has designated who is to receive it after he is put to death. He has also designated who will receive his remains.
He has been strip searched, x-rayed, and issued a new set of clothes, shoes, mattress &amp; bedding.
"I want to share with you what the process of the execution is like in Oklahoma. 

#JuliusJones has been on death watch for more than 2 weeks. In preparation for his execution on Nov. 18, he is alone in his prison cell just feet away from the executioner’s chamber."
Julius, his family and everyone on his team are  still hopeful Stitt will do the right thing. Today Julius' family and close friends received invites to his execution. I can’t even imagine how they all must be feeling right now.
He can choose to accept the recommendation (for a 2nd time) from the Parole Board, to grant Julius Clemency/Life w. the possibility of parole or have him executed Thursday the 18th.
I want to give u all an update on Julius Jones. We are all anxiously awaiting a decision from Governor Stitt.
OMG Happy Birthday to the one and only @TheKimbino 🖤🖤🖤 I hope you are celebrating and living it up

Thank you @GovStitt &amp; everyone who marched for @justice4julius today! The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole board voted 3-1 to recommend clemency and to commute Julius’s sentence to life with the possibility of parole. The fight isn’t over and he needs to come home #JusticeForJulius🙏🏼
