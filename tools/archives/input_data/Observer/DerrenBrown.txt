@JustHarrySeth thank you so much for travelling, and for your kind gift and letter. I‚Äôve left your name at stage door if you want to say hello after - I don‚Äôt really meet people as I can‚Äôt afford to get ill and there‚Äôs a lot going round. But come say hi.
@Jack8Track yes of course! Thank you so much x
Thank you to the group of friends who stood in a circle outside the Apollo after the show tonight talking about the show. A dangerous game to play but I stood with my back to you, behind the guy who has the podcast, listening to it all. (Thanks for saying such lovely things) X
@DeborahIsitt thank you. We love it so much xx

Christmas tip - if you‚Äôre feeling fucking miserable, stick Nativity! on, (with Martin Freeman, Marc Wootton &amp; Ashley Jensen from that magical time when it was all about British comedy). It works and you have a nice cry and it cheers you right up good and proper.
I‚Äôve been doing the shows this week with a thick and horrible lurgy. Just about made it through in a daze. Travelling home with a painful throat and I suspect Christmas will be spent in bed. See you on the other side, and sorry if I coughed on any of you.

Richard Jr inherited the estate and performed for a while longer as Little Potter: though all records of the son end in 1840. Some years later though, Houdini took a keen interest in Potter Sr, following reports that he had performed a version of the elusive Hindu Rope Trick...
"and spat flames and sparks. He made chicks appear in ladies‚Äô pockets, and bumblebees in men‚Äôs hats. He became by some reports, the best known magician and ventriloquist of his time. 
Richard died in 1835 aged 52, and his wife Sally a year year later, aged 49. Their son..."
"spirits will not be tolerant of you!‚Äô The magician-ventriloquist broke open a bottle, to reveal a baby chick inside. It looked at the church elders and shouted ‚ÄòBoo!‚Äô. They fled in fear. 
In his act, Potter fried eggs in a beaver hat, swallowed swords, caused an egg to dance..."
"his own career. 
He did very well, saving enough to start a farm and build a home for his family, where he would host large dinner parties. On one occasion, when a church official objected to alcohol being served, Potter yelled ‚ÄòIf you are not tolerant of the spirits, then..."
Scottish magician John Rannie, who would seemingly decapitate and restore a chicken during his act (David Blaine performed a similar piece centuries later in a TV special). Later Richard became very successful as a ventriloquist and eventually Rannie stepped back to allow him...
Probably the first American-born magician was Richard Potter, born in 1783 in Massachusetts, just as the American Revolution ended. Richard was black, and no  records of earlier American magicians have been found. The nation‚Äôs first magician began as the assistant of a (1/x) https://t.co/m5RcZWJ5j5

He died in Toronto, in 1897, his published story becoming one of the best known of the genre. ‚ÄòThe Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself‚Äô is available - I‚Äôd recommend the John Ernest second edition.
Henry has been the subject of documentaries, operas, exhibitions and performance pieces. With profits from his autobiography he built and exhibited a powerful panorama: 50,000 feet of canvas (reportedly) that was slowly unwound to reveal paintings depicting scenes of slavery...
In the 1850s he lived in England and then the US, becoming a magician and mesmerist, using the names ‚ÄòProf H Box Brown‚Äô and ‚ÄòAfrican Prince‚Äô. Never reunited with his family, he was remarried to an English woman and eventually, with their three kids, they formed a family act...
and a single hole cut for air. Arrangements having been made, Henry mailed himself some 250 miles to abolitionists in Philadelphia - a 27 hour journey. When he arrived, he stepped out of the box with the words ‚ÄòHow do you do, Gentlemen?‚Äô and sang a psalm...
"from him, he was determined to escape. 
Henry accomplished this by first burning his hand to the bone with sulphuric acid, allowing him to get out of work. Then he climbed into the box that would give him his nickname, measuring 3ft x 2ft x2.5 ft, ‚ÄòDry Goods‚Äô written across it..."
Henry ‚ÄòBox‚Äô Brown - another magician with an extraordinary story. He lived in slavery with his wife and three children in Virginia. Henry paid his wife‚Äôs master to not sell his family but was betrayed (his wife Nancy was pregnant at the time she was sold). His family stolen... https://t.co/XhyQtXpgGS

theatre. That (and his claim to immortality, which I think is underused nowadays) made his actual death appear to be a hoax. The audience followed the body to the funeral home, anticipating resurrection, and his assistant took the opportunity to charge admission.
Black Herman, a famous African-American magician, who died in Kentucky in 1934, reportedly on stage, and no-one believed it. He would be ‚Äòburied alive‚Äô a few days prior to a performance and then start his show by being sensationally exhumed, before leading the audience to the https://t.co/nBXNjWtVSx

I was blow-drying the taxidermy (keeps the dust out and moths away) and I found on top of a pig attached to a balloon on the ceiling a small missing piece of an 18th century automaton that my parrot had clearly stolen and stored there. I‚Äôm sure I am not alone in this.

Disappointed, as I seek baking books for further cake adventures, that the nation‚Äôs favourite patissier doesn‚Äôt have a festive collection called ‚ÄòA Mary Berry Christmas‚Äô.

@Dishoom apologies, I missed this: that‚Äôs very kind of you. It was a big birthday spread so rather sad. Presumably an unfortunate aspect of @deliveroo (appalling trying to inquire via chatbot where the food was). First and last time I use them. Thank you though for responding. Dx

Many of you trying to buy Showman tickets today pointed out the site was down. I like to think it was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of activity: busier than an East London park in lockdown. It‚Äôs back up and running now, so thank you and please do.

@mountyRC oh man. So sorry to hear that. I hope it was enough of a funeral and that you‚Äôre able to be around for each other - it‚Äôs so strange and remote not being able to do that. Very touched to be included. Lotsalove x
"I do us fried egg, beans and toast for brekkie:
