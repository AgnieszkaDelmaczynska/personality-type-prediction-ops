2. Having said that, don‚Äôt be a douchebag and tweet out @elonmusk‚Äôs jet‚Äôs location or anything else that cld endanger him or his family. It‚Äôs not ethical &amp; it‚Äôs not newsworthy so don‚Äôt wrap yourself in fake virtue if you retweeted it.
1. If I were @elonmusk I wld make sure I had security protecting my jet instead of pretending we can stop terrible ppl from publicly disclosing its location. Many celebs live in homes known to be theirs-not great, but life as a public figure. Whack-a-mole on the speech d/n/work.

All the jury did for her was say Depp misled about her messing up a hotel room. THEY REJECTED VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING SHE TESTIFIED TO. That she‚Äôs been lying about Depp for years. That she maliciously tried to destroy him.
Don‚Äôt be fooled by her one claim prevailing - this was a total defeat for her.
Amber Heard wins one of her counterclaims for defamation - and $2m compensatory damages against Depp on one stmt re her staging a disheveled scene for cops. No punitives.
Huge damages - $10m compensatory; $5m punitive - Heard must pay Depp
Jury finds Heard‚Äôs claim that she had rare vantage point of seeing how institutions protect men accused of abuse was defamatory
Jury finds Heard‚Äôs claim in WAPO that she was a victim of domestic abuse is defamatory
Jury finds Heard‚Äôs claim in WAPO of sexual violence was defamatory
Depp-Heard! Someone won (proved defamation) and is getting something. That‚Äôs all we know bc the jury screwed up the form &amp; had to go back to jury room. Agonizing wait for the parties/lawyers.

@beyondreasdoubt Old habits, right?
Our country is so divided right now, and this is one of the most difficult, emotional issues. Genuinely good, loving ppl on both sides (tho not reflected on Twitter). Feels like a good time to say a prayer &amp; love thy neighbor.
It‚Äôs hard to read this draft opinion &amp; not feel deeply for the pro-life advocates who have worked tirelessly for five decades in the hopes of one day reading these words, or for the pro-choice advocates who have worked equally hard to avoid them.
Draft op.: ‚ÄúRoe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak &amp; [it]had damaging consequences‚Ä¶It is time to‚Ä¶return the issue to the ppl‚Äôs elected representatives [where it will] be resolved‚Ä¶by citizens trying to persuade one another &amp; then voting.‚Äù https://t.co/Lx3CMpgYOn
Draft op.: ‚Äúeven if we cld foresee [how society will respond to this] ‚Ä¶ we wld have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job‚Ä¶We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe &amp; Casey must be overruled.‚Äù Wow https://t.co/n918SmVKa0
Hey Clueless-I have never said how I feel about the abortion issue. Never. Go back &amp; check.

Covid risk is lower, heart risk is more concerning. In short: pls study your ass from your elbow. https://t.co/0VVuHkNrWU

@Nanny715 @BlackCatBone5 There is also a mandatory vaccine policy at the school. The kids of age all have been vaccinated AND MUST WEAR MASKS ALL DAY in addition to plexiglass etc. ‚Äî while around only vaccinated ppl. There is no getting around the disgusting hypocrisy.
@BlackCatBone5 Even the vaccinated children are masked all day. Does that change it for you?
@WhosePolitics No, it‚Äôs not about being vaccinated. The kids who are of age &amp; vaccinated ALSO must wear masks ALL DAY in our schools and in all of our state‚Äôs schools. So just stop - you have no idea what you are taking about.
Our 8, 10 &amp; 11 yr olds are in masks ALL DAY at school. They eat lunch divided from the other kids by plexiglass - there is no conversation. These pics of these elitist snobs w/no masks, surrounded by crowds, eating &amp; dancing the nite away - are INFURIATING.

‚Ä¶ squeezed the asses of many staffers &amp; felt up the chest of a woman who met him on a rope line‚Ä¶ then retaliated against one by trying to ruin her reputation. NYAG: he denied some but not all and in any event ‚Äúwe found the Governor‚Äôs denials to be contrived.‚Äù
NY AG says: Gov Cuomo grabbed his assist‚Äôs breast under her blouse‚Ä¶felt up the stomach &amp; back of a state trooper &amp; asked for her help finding a girlfriend who ‚Äúcan handle pain,‚Äù told a young aide he was ‚Äúlonely &amp; wanted to be touched,‚Äù kissed employees ag. their will on lips‚Ä¶

@thomaschattwill I agree. I also feel like some may need a reminder that not being ‚Äúwoke‚Äù/seeing racism/sexism/etc. everywhere does not mean one refuses to see it anywhere.
@CathyYoung63 Don Lemon has been credibly accused of sexually assaulting a man in a bar w/a witness. No problem. Chris Cuomo conspired against Gov. A Cuomo‚Äôs accusers. Fine! Toobin gets off in front of a newsroom of ppl. Welcome back! Yeah, I really do think so Cathy.
@CathyYoung63 That‚Äôs a straw man. Toobin didn‚Äôt ‚Äúaccidentally expose‚Äù himself. He jerked off on cam in front of his colleagues. If a woman did that, in a newsroom controlled by powerful men, you‚Äôre kidding yourself if you think she‚Äôd be saved. It wouldn‚Äôt matter what some feminists said.
Biden admin eliminates the term ‚Äúmom‚Äù in favor of ‚Äúbirthing people.‚Äù Mom is not an offensive word &amp; those claiming otherwise are not the broader trans community but unhinged woke propagandists &amp; their self-flagellating ‚Äúallies.‚Äù https://t.co/v3NG7HpeJW
