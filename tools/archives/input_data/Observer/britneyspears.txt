I have a premiere for a

LEGISLATIVE ACT OF MY
PUSSY“ !!!! https                 //t.co/WjhMoiybxO
We are nominated for Best
Collaboration at the

would feel … but see, that
will never happen !!! The
only good thing that
happened for me was that it
ended !!! I don’t see how
they get to walk away so
easily and get away with
what was done to me … the
world has shown me and
the world only that cruelty
wins !!!
all through those things with
no fucking reason at all and
have him call his family and
they say WE DON’T KNOW
!!! I’d like to see the state of
California sit back and have
4 security men at a trailer
house for months telling him
he can’t ever leave !!! I’d
like to see how he
… take his car away … his
home away … his door to
privacy away … sit him
down 7 days a week from 8
am to 6 pm being asked
questions and people
treating him like a science
experience … monitoring his
food … no phone … nurses
watch him shower and dress
… I want him to go
to join the cliche yet when I
called them in that place
they said it’s not illegal but it
may seem illegal with what
they are doing … because
what your in is DIFFERENT
… different my ass !!! It’s
been many months since it
has been over … my wish is
to take my father to a place
for me … They hurt me and
I did absolutely nothing
wrong … I have no justice
at all in my eyes … at all !!!
The court system ended it
TWO YEARS after I told
them about 15 years of my
abuse … my home friends
jumping up and down when
the judge ruled it to be over
… a metaphor
for no reason at all … I
believe in consequences …
I believe I have absolutely
nothing to prove on the
whereabouts of what was
done to me … it is all known
!!! With that being said,
people who have mistreated
me on that kind of scale just
ending the system is not
good enough
I’m posting this for the
second time today because
I believe in a world where
we all deserve justice !!! 15
years in a system of
secretive and manipulative
abuse … JUST ENDING IT
has never been good
enough for me and it will
never be !!! I was talked to
abusively and punished

A reminder to some of you
who may have gotten what I
said confused … it was 6
small vials of blood not 6
gallons !!!
You can lose your
individuality on a fake tale of
how other people may
percieve you and some
idiots like me fall into the
trap cause unfortunately I
do care … but at the end of
the day …
I’m honored and I feel loved
  by his awareness and
acknowledgement, not by
only my involement with a
song but by my struggles
and what I’ve been through
!!! He knows the hardships
of the world on a bigger
scale ...
Complacency has always
been a boring tactic that
feels safe … music ...
creation ... producing is
where my heart lies and lifts
me with inspiration !!! I’ve
had the opportunity to work
with someone who is
beautiful and kind on all
levels …
Just touching on the door

Psss I messed up at the

I want to be fearless like
when I was younger and not
be so scared and fearful. I
pray there actually is truth to
the Holy Spirit and I hope
that spirit is with my children
as well !!! Yes … I choose
happiness and joy today ☀️
!!!
I’m learning everyday is a
clean slate to try and be a
better person and do what
makes me happy … yes I
choose happiness today. I
tell myself every day to let
go of the hurt bitterness and
try to forgive myself and
others to what may have
been hurtful.
Okie dokie … my first song
in 6 years !!!! It’s pretty
damn cool that I’m singing
with one of
the most classic men of our
time … @eltonofficial !!!!
I’m kinda overwhelmed…
it’s a big deal to me !!! I’m
meditating more ​♀️ and
learning my space is
valuable and precious !!!
Good God I love my fans so
much it’s crazy ❤️ !!! I think
I’m gonna cry the rest of the
day !!!! Best day ever …
praise the Lord … can I get
an Amen ☀️ ????

We all have our own ways
to work on our bodies and I
respect that cause we all

like last night when I ate a
container of peanuts
     ​♀️ ​♀️ ​♀️ !!!! And then it hit
me ... I might look better but
I felt too vulnerable in my
skin being this small !!!! I
didn't like it so I started
boxing so now I feel
stronger too !!!!
In the past two weeks I've
said that's it ... I have got to
get in shape considering my
boyfriend's body is hotter
than hot !!!! I was like
SHIT where the hell am I
supposed to start            ... so I
run a lot and try to eat clean
and be mindful with my food
unless I cheat https                  //t.co/c1paXPpEuO

Traveling from hotel to hotel
can make you a little stir
crazy, so I decided to start
doing 2 hours of yoga in
each room! The bare floors
gave me a pretty solid grip
on the ground without a
mat. I was very sore the
next day, but at least I got to
use my time wisely
