Bolduc entered the army as a private and rose to general. He is very smart and hard working. He won with a people’s grassroots campaign. He can beat Hassan (who has very low reelect numbers in polls) with the same approach.
Don Bolduc, with a grassroots campaign with very little money won the GOP New Hampshire senate primary by defeating the establishment candidate who had $4million in outside help. Senator Maggie Hassan is the weakest Democrat up for reelection. Every Republican should help Bolduc.

As the House considers adding 87,000 IRS agents Friday shouldnt it ask why the IRS has 4,500 guns and 5 million rounds of ammunition.  Is the deep state steadily militarizing so it can dominate and intimidate the American people.A vote yes is a vote for an out of control IRS.
"As the House votes friday to add 87,000 new IRS agents it should know how violent the IRS is becoming:According to the IRS job listing, a”Key Requirement”is:”Be legally allowed to carry a firearm.""
""Major Duties:Carry a firearm and be willing to use deadly force, if necessary."""

Haas typifies traditional national security-foreign policy establishment which would sacrifice Ukraine to keep Putin helping on a sell out to Iran. Biden uses “war criminal” and “butcher” to describe Putin. Then caves to establishment desire to “deal” with a butcher-war criminal.
Richard Haas recommends Biden”make clear US prepared to deal with this Russian govt.”so destroying Mariupol, transporting people to Russia, bombing children,waging a terror campaign,with all this the US should “deal with this Russian govt.”?Better to first defeat them in Ukraine.
Since it is clear Biden has failed Congress should move this week to insist on effective military aid to Ukraine NOW. Ukrainians are dying while Biden speaks baloney he doesnt mean. Congress must ACT NOW!
Zelenskyy was right to lash out at Biden and NATO. Biden’s trip was a complete failure if the goal is to help Ukraine. Helping refugees settle is the wrong goal. Helping refugees return to a free Ukraine is the right goal.

Drug pricing is a broken system not because of pharmaceutical co. profits (which drive innovation) but because of the broken marketplace and shell games that drive “savings” from “discounts” to middlemen instead of patients.
Biden and Dems want to cap OOP on insulin, but what about other medicines? Rebate rule (which Dems killed) would have applied to all medicines, and maybe more important - would have helped fix underlying problems causing prices to rise.
Biden RX event is a good reminder that the Democrats killed the rebate rule to “pay for” the infrastructure bill, which would have saved seniors money at the pharmacy counter on all medicines.
