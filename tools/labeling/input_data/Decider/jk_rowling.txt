No, Laura, the matter isn't closed. You haven't retracted or apologised for your original assertion that I asked/demanded that the SoA put out a statement mentioning me alongside Salman. On the contrary, you've just repeated it. Twitter is evidently not the place to resolve this. https://t.co/MLqqbYcjDi
@RachelCDailey She's just repeated her accusation. Try and keep up.
Defamation is not free speech. I did not ask to be included in the statement made by the SoA after the attack on Salman, nor do I believe asking Twitter support to take down an account telling me 'you're next' was wrong. I await your apology and retraction. 5/5
You made a false, extremely unpleasant allegation from behind a block and are now complaining that it got sufficient traction that I saw it. I would have been able to address you directly or privately had you not blocked me. We both retain our free speech. 4/5 https://t.co/FTwahTczTC
I did not tweet about Harris's poll. Nor did I comment on Harris's long, self-indulgent thread about her own problems with stalkers and fans, immediately after the attack on Rushdie. I did ask Twitter support for help with one of several death threats I received that day. 3/5 https://t.co/1PSTOD5oGH
Now you use the weasel words 'or maybe your followers' focus.' In the immediate aftermath of Salman's attempted murder, @joannechocolat, the president of the SoA, tweeted a flippant poll about death threats to authors. This was seen by some as a veiled dig at me. 2/5 https://t.co/o3ZXXgl0CB
As @TinyWriterLaura still has me blocked, I can only respond to her here. I've never asked the Society of Authors to issue any statement concerning me, whether by tweet, email or letter. You've just repeated the accusation that I 'asked' the SoA to issue a statement. False. 1/5 https://t.co/7yXjzUjE4B
@OliverFindlay @TinyWriterLaura I'm sure it will be, but the request for an apology and retraction stands and she'll need to unblock me so I can see it. Alternatively, she can just show me her evidence that I demanded to be included in the statement.
Should be 'included in', not 'included on', of course, but I bet even professional proof readers miss stuff when they're seriously pissed off.
I let 99.9% of bonkers lies about me on Twitter glide past for the sake of my own sanity, but alleging I tried to capitalise on the stabbing of somebody I know, and who's long been a hero to me, crosses a line. An apology and a retraction seems in order. 2/2
Could somebody not blocked by writer and journalist @TinyWriterLaura (she's blocked me) please ask her to show her evidence that I've ever 'demanded' to be included on any Society of Authors official statement, let alone one about the attempted murder of Salman Rushdie? 1/2 https://t.co/kdB8XNH49s
@blablafishcakes Not a word of it, and the proof's on Twitter for all to see. It's a truly vile thing to say, though.

@rtaskeeter @JKRsBarmyBooks I discovered Charlotte Mew while doing my Victorian readfest and she's a definite exception to the rule, I love her work and now own all her poems. I also love Christina Rossetti, as you'll probably have gathered because I took the title of the first Strike from her.
@0PantheraTigris @CormStrikeFan @JKRsBarmyBooks Don't worry, he's not built to be skinny!
@JKRsBarmyBooks I can't promise he won't make any more lousy emotional choices going forwards, but the IBH is a watershed moment for him. Something fundamental has changed. It's just a shame (for him) it took him this long!
@JKRsBarmyBooks I think he's broken in ways he doesn't want to deal with, which makes him compartmentalise to an extent that's increasingly damaging (to himself as well as others) and unsustainable.
@JKRsBarmyBooks I think Strike mounts his own best defence while he's thinking about Madeline, while in the car with Robin. He thinks that 'people use each other all the time' - which wouldn't be my personal view, but it's his best means of justifying his own behaviour to himself.
@JKRsBarmyBooks Went to get myself a cup of tea and missed this! So - great question, but a little black and white. Has he used women? Definitely, though only once did the woman realise she was being used (Nina) and she had it out with him, too. Is he a good man? I'd say he's a flawed good man.
@JKRsBarmyBooks ❤️
@JKRsBarmyBooks That was wonderful! Thanks to all of you! 🖤
@JKRsBBAWestMids @JKRsBarmyBooks Patience, is all I can say right now. Have patience!
@robinloveSEDA @JKRsBarmyBooks Happy relationships make bad fiction. Rest assured, I have a plan.
@gbjeffen @JKRsBarmyBooks Yes, yes, yes, well spotted! There's a definite Aurora Leigh connection, all the way to Zoe/Marian Erle.
@JKRsBarmyBooks Ah, THAT question. Well... Strike's now FINALLY admitted to himself how he feels, while Robin's telling herself she needs to stop feeling what SHE feels... in short, I wouldn't expect this to happen immediately. But I'm not saying never!
@MDayCassandra @JKRsBarmyBooks You want me to do a Hitchcock? Actually, the producer did suggest I sit in the background in a pub scene one time, when I was watching filming, but I really hate seeing myself on screen so it would ruin my enjoyment of watching the finished series!

@CormStrikeFan @JKRsBarmyBooks Which is exactly how I spent my last birthday but one. Took the family to Highgate Cemetery (3rd visit for me, 1st for kids) because I needed to check something for the book and knew they had to humour me that day, at least.
@JKRsBarmyBooks hahaha, Midge is young, very physically fit and hot. I think I should slap on a wig and play Pat.
@badly_wired @TheSEFilesPod @missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks There you go! My oldest friend is a veteran (I did *not* base Strike on him, I must add, he's a happily married man and dissimilar in many other ways), but he's definitely got that mixture of compassion and practicality.
@LindsayMLand @JKRsBarmyBooks You meet her in the next one and you're right to like her.
@WackyPidgeon @JKRsBarmyBooks 😂
@JKRsBarmyBooks Somebody (not Robin) does suggest therapy to him in the next book!
@FeelsAndOTPs @JKRsBarmyBooks Definitely.
@CormStrikeFan @JKRsBarmyBooks I've got bad news for you. You'd better smoke all you can before now and the publication of the next one!
@JKRsBarmyBooks I was reading so many Victorian female poets to put me in the mindset and I joked to a friend of mine they had only 3 subjects: 'Lo, behold the bumble bee,' 'Woe is me, the baby's dead' and 'God, thou art stern but will save us.'
@JKRsBarmyBooks And this brought me back to the Victorian romanticisation of sickness and death, which in a very strange way connected to some of what I saw on Tumblr. I saw definite parallels between Victorian attitudes and modern ones.
@JKRsBarmyBooks He reaches a crisis in this book and is forced up against some hard facts: change your lifestyle, or your career’s over. And his health crisis mirrors his emotional crisis. He’s voluntarily lived in denial about his feelings for Robin and change is forced upon him there, too.
@JKRsBarmyBooks but there was a sickness in the online refuge they found, too. And then you've got the more literal illnesses and disabilities in the book, people struggling with the daily reality of chronic illness, pain and so on, not least Strike.
@JKRsBarmyBooks Most were looking for those things that keep anomie at bay - community, friendship, a hobby – and there’s nothing ignoble about wanting those things, we all need them. Yet things have become toxic inside the game: they thought they’d found an escape from the real world
@JKRsBarmyBooks real life friends, family, sense of purpose, meaningful work and so on. Then you’ve got obsession, which when extreme can become mental illness. In the mods of the game, we have a group of individuals who’ve latched on to TIBH and whose obsession becomes central to their lives.
@JKRsBarmyBooks This is a biggie. The central theme of TIBH is sickness. At the (dark) heart is anomie, a sickness of disconnection, the kind of amoral nihilism you find in people who find no place for themselves in any of the sustaining things that keep human beings grounded –
@missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks V important character moment for Strike. Army, isn't it? I know a few veterans. They'd do that, no bother, and not make the recipient feel embarrassed about it, either.
@0PantheraTigris @JKRsBarmyBooks You know, it's funny (&amp; this has happened to me countless times), *I* didn't know what Drek was until I was some way into writing the book. I conjured him back to front and had to work it out like Strike - oh, of course, he's got the scythe (nose), he's got the black cloak - duh.
@gbjeffen @JKRsBarmyBooks It's a reverse image of Silkworm in some ways. This time, the killer isn't a creator, though we surmise they'd like to be.
.@JKRsBBAWestMids John Boyne said something very interesting about that in a recent interview. He said particularly vicious trolls really do want their victims to die, that they're locked into that online game mentality where the more kills you get, the quicker you level up. https://t.co/Re20uQb1XT
@missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks Such a perfect way of putting it. Mortality and illness are central to this book. It's really impossible to visit Highgate Cemetery and not ponder your own mortality. The very air smells of death - bones, anyway.
.@ForWomenScot That's the conundrum, isn't it? Both human and less than human. What I found interesting about this particular killer was that they had a degree of insight into their own malaise, as Robin spotted from the start. Why call yourself Anomie? https://t.co/YoJsQQnsMW
@JKRsBarmyBooks You're right: this book deals with death on many levels. Death of conscience. Death of the creator. Death of a community, because what happens in the book breaks apart something that had once been happy and sustaining.
@erkstagwitch @kitten1805 @JKRsBarmyBooks I adore Pat. She was inspired by an older woman I knew, now sadly deceased, who was very funny, very judgemental and at bottom, incredibly kind.
@robinloveSEDA @JKRsBarmyBooks That's such a nice thing to say. I was trying to explore the full gamut of obsessive fandom through the moderators of the game. Some were there in search of a refuge, an escape from their own troubled lives. I empathise strongly with that.
@FrenchFem @JKRsBarmyBooks That IS a compliment!
.@mw_mairi That's something that's always fascinated me. Even before I was published, in youth, I'd meet people (often fans of rock bands) who seemed to feel they were somehow also in the band, that they should be making key decisions and so on. https://t.co/S1sauQ6ppm
@missedith01 @JKRsBarmyBooks Funnily enough (and I do mean funnily) if I'd copied and pasted from what I get sent, nobody would have believed half of it - at least, not the people who aren't on Twitter!
@gbjeffen @JKRsBarmyBooks No, I always planned cold case, THEN an internet-based case. I wanted a complete contrast, something (almost) bang up to date.
.@CormStrikeFan Order out of chaos. PD James said something so brilliant: 'every single time, a little catharsis.' There's the satisfaction of trying to solve (or construct) the puzzle, but I love the genre because you can do so much with it. And I love world building! https://t.co/zbjD1QbvO8
@erkstagwitch @JKRsBarmyBooks That's such a lovely comment. I really did work hard to capture the tone and flavour of different online communities. I'd never been on Tumblr before, for instance. That was a HUGE education.

@judgejules75 Love to all of you! 💜🤍💚

PS: I've just found out the trust, which was at just over £70m, is currently slightly below, but that's Liz Truss's fault, not mine.
and yes, I've poured time and money into a 17-year-and-counting campaign to ending child institutionalisation with @lumos. However, I accept that my efforts are pitiful compared to the critical humanitarian work of calling women TERFs all day on Twitter. #humbled #inspired 2/2
Today in my mentions I learn that I never cared about women's rights or child protection until the last couple of years. True, in 2000 I established the Volant Charitable Trust https://t.co/PwOuZIpgbD, which is now worth £70m, to focus on women's and children's issues, 1/2
@judgejules75 @ForWomenScot Big ❤️ to both of you!
@DarcyWAHF @ForWomenScot Guilty of wearing a dangerous T-shirt, huh? Well, women’s words ARE ‘literal violence’ 😘
I stand in solidarity with @ForWomenScot and all women protesting and speaking outside the Scottish parliament. #NoToSelfID https://t.co/5vZNaZu13H
This fantastic 🧵 explains why women in Scotland are standing up. #WomensRally #WomensRights #WomenWontWheesht https://t.co/GziKB8r8EM
Perfect example. The problem isn't that a man who  wrote sympathetically about orgasming 'on or with' a child was made trustee of a children's charity, but that the TERFs might 'twist' his appointment. Then straight back to the self-soothing mantras, with a glow of inner virtue. https://t.co/KwDWSK2B79
@JoeGayHistorian No, thank you. People like you remind me how many wonderful allies there are out there xxx
@jayrotoole You are straw manning in an attempt to deflect blame from a movement that is kinder to rapists than women and more protective of big pharma than vulnerable children. Literally nobody here is disagreeing that most trans people are decent. The paedophile apologist isn't trans.
@ATRward1349 Again, Andrew: which minority are you talking about?
For the legions of the blocked. https://t.co/cEwOG8h43u
India, I swear to God, if you want to start a petition for Mermaids to take me on in court, the first signature will be mine. https://t.co/1HZ6BbCX55
@ATRward1349 Which minority group is this, Andrew? The pharmaceutical companies and doctors raking in cash? The queer theorists indifferent to real world consequences of dismantling safeguarding? Or are you defending PhD students who write papers on orgasming 'on or with' children?
You still prefer wilful blindness and four word mantras to considering you might have got this badly wrong. You became part of an authoritarian, misogynist, homophobic movement and you didn't even notice. Enjoy the sense of your own righteousness while you can. It won't last. 3/3
when you shrugged off masked men roughing up lesbian protestors and tried to shout down detransitioners talking about what was done to them by ideologically-captured doctors. Women, gay people and vulnerable kids have suffered real harm and you? You cheered it all on. 2/3
I note the genderists are now arguing that it doesn't matter that a paedophilia apologist was a trustee of a trans children's charity, because he was 'only one'. You know, I thought things were pretty bad when you were arguing to put convicted rapists in women's jails, 1/3
@babooshka2002 @Mermaids_Gender I would urge you to read what he's actually written if you believe his aim is to prevent paedophiles offending rather than normalising and destigmatising paedophiliac desires/behaviours.

@Mirbee1111 @MrSanity @francesweetman ❤️
@kelly_white_2 I’m so sorry for your loss. I’ve seen this  reaction to female-specific trauma time and again. All ‘lived experience’ is held sacred by the genderists except that of women, whose pain is minimised, jeered at or framed as a self-serving lie. Misogyny 101.
@MrSanity @francesweetman Because I'm not scared of cenobites 😉
@francesweetman You know the box in Hellraiser? That.
@francesweetman Nah, I've seen crazier. As Mermaids defenders go, she's  only about halfway up the league table. Some of our biggest names still haven't thrown their hats into the ring, so I think that coveted top spot's wide open.
If I'd been arguing for the destigmatisation of paedophilia ten years ago, had never recanted those views and then wheedled my way onto the board of a charity for vulnerable kids, then damn right I should be fired. https://t.co/eiFhQDFR60
When you appoint a trustee to a children's charity, you do due diligence. A simple google search would have enabled Mermaids to read Breslow's own words. Either they did literally no checking, or they were fine with his views. Either way, it's a catastrophic safeguarding failure. https://t.co/TBWHiDbXca
That's pretty damn optimistic of you, Twitter. https://t.co/EWmdOw83I2
@dip89dw And I wouldn't need a whole gnat's worth.
So I don't doubt that there are some panicky phone calls being placed to PR people by certain  corporations and celebrities right now, but as they remain completely insulated from the severe harm they've enabled, my sympathy can be measured in gnats' thimbles. 5/X
They've been allowed into classrooms, trained police and had unprecedented influence over health policy, even though by their own admission they aren't a medical charity. We've also found out they're sending devices to flatten breasts to underage girls w/o parental consent. 4/5
They couldn't have achieved it without the money and public support of certain corporations and celebrities, who eagerly boosted them even though the red flags have been there for years. Mermaids' fingers were all over the Tavistock Gender Identity Clinic debacle. 3/5
We've now learned that Mermaids appointed a paedophilia apologist as Trustee and that their online moderator encouraged kids to move onto a platform notorious for sexual exploitation. This is a charity that's achieved unprecedented influence in the UK. 2/5 https://t.co/7guDJYAalJ

I've just gone to look it up. Eleven people claimed to have seen the plates, some of them related to Smith, but there's debate as to whether this was a metaphysical experience or they genuinely saw them. And one man was allowed to hold the box but not look inside it.

@guerrero_ramey @SpitfireAudio Because I see them as sticking up for the rights of women and girls. I see them as defending the language by which women can describe their sex-specific needs and rights.
@guerrero_ramey @SpitfireAudio ... it isn’t hate to speak the truth,' and 'People who menstruate, I'm sure there used to be a word for them etc.' You consider those tweets to demonstrate hatred of trans people/hate speech?
@guerrero_ramey @SpitfireAudio Ok, so we're going with: 'If sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction. If sex isn’t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased.

Walsh believes feminism is 'rotten' and his default appears to be denigrating women with whom he disagrees. He's no more on my side than the 'shut up or we'll bomb you' charmers who cloak their misogyny in a pretty pink and blue flag. 4/4
but a shared belief that women exist as a biological class (and water's wet and the moon's not made of cheese) does not an ally make. I believe women are susceptible to certain harms and have specific needs and that feminism is necessary to secure and protect our rights. 3/4
Like many women on the left, I despair that so many self-proclaimed liberals turn a blind eye to the naked misogyny of the gender identity movement and the threat it poses to the rights of women and girls. Walsh's film undeniably exposed what many leftists are too scared to, 2/4
Respectfully, I've been facing down the Punch-and-Kill-TERFs brigade for a while now and not once have I thought, 'what I really want is to hand this over to a man who thinks feminism is one of the worst things to happen to western civilisation.'  1/4 https://t.co/yL3uZF0Udb

I'm so bloody angry my hands are shaking. I'm the daughter of a disabled mother and I've campaigned for the rights of vulnerable children for many years, but I'm still constantly shocked by the cruelty and indifference shown to those who cannot advocate for themselves. 4/5
Predators go where there is access. Predators love victims who can't fight back or speak out. Successive studies show that 98-99% of sexual abusers are male. This validation of male feelings over disabled girls' protection is abhorrent. 3/5
Nearly 20 years ago I founded @lumos to reform care systems for vulnerable children. I know from long experience how vulnerable children are in institutions. The statistics on predation are appalling. Disabled women and children are many times more likely to be abused. 2/5

@LiteraryGoon Beautiful minions!
@trevoices You know how much I admire you, Scott, and I'm so sorry to hear you get it too. The way you've stood up has been an inspiration.
@MattWalshBlog And your film did a good job exposing the incoherence of gender identity theory and some of the harms it's done. Many institutions I used to admire have uncritically embraced this dogma, but I reserve my ire for them rather than shouting 'coward' at individual women.
@ImWatson91 I'm really sorry. It's just appalling and I know it's widespread.
I'm not there for men calling women cowards when they never have to face this stuff themselves, nor am I ok with white guys publicly telling black women how to comport themselves. Men whose default is policing women's speech and actions are not allies. https://t.co/7615iIE6FX

@varindeus Gender identity ideology has allowed a ton of unreconstructed misogynists to drop the pose and unleash all their woman hate in public and my god, aren’t they loving it.
If you’ve got a strong stomach, read Dr Em’s article (second tweet in her thread). Another male gender identity activist - one of the most notorious - calls disabled women wanting privacy and dignity ‘disgusting’.

Now got a lot of people reminding me King’s Cross is a real place. I promise I don’t think I made it up (or Charing Cross Road either)! I’m talking about  wizarding world locations like Godric’s Hollow, the Leaky Cauldron, Diagon Alley, wh are often claimed to have ‘real’ models.
Afraid not, but I know the graveyard you’re talking about because unbeknownst to me, one of my children was at a loose end one afternoon and went on one of those Potter walking tours with their best mate for a laugh. They came home with a ton of information that was news to me 😂 https://t.co/E6JbtDIrDy
as the second house I lived in as a child (which did have a cupboard under the stairs). Dull but true: I haven’t even been to many of the cities containing the self-proclaimed ‘real’ Diagon Alleys! 3/X
No real street inspired Diagon Alley, I’m afraid. It came out of my head! I’ve never seen 99% of the places that claim to be the inspiration and I’d never seen Victoria St when I created DA (I have since, obviously, as it’s in Edinburgh, where I live). 1/3 https://t.co/66dpltNUcW

@SourPatches2077 I hear you and I truly honour you for taking ownership of that while (I hope) still having compassion for yourself. I've read your writing on why you transitioned and it stayed with me because it was so raw, honest and insightful.
@bindelj We'll be heating individual baked beans over a single candle and sipping rainwater out of a rusty tin can.
There has been a sign. I can't ignore the promptings of fate. To the Barmy Book Army I shall go.

Anyway, if a DM should happen to drop into my messages with these unknown details, I may have to consider it a sign.
I was just thinking, 'I really fancy dropping in on a random book group that might not even be in my city , of which I don't know the time or date, yet is maybe called something like JKR's Barmy Book Army.' You know how these random thoughts occur sometimes, mid-chapter. https://t.co/1akAcq1WNI
@leahcuerden1 @SourPatches2077 I’m so sorry. That’s an appalling thing to have experienced.
@DBBooper @SourPatches2077 I hope you’re not talking about yourself, right now? Because there’s always, always a reason to stay alive, even when you can’t see it or believe in it.
@pedaldancer123 @SourPatches2077 I’m so sorry. Life’s also taught me we can never know anyone completely, however much we love them. If someone’s adept at hiding what they’re going through, there’s a limit to what we can do, even though we’d have done anything to help if we’d known.
@Hengist123 @SourPatches2077 I truly understand this and I know it’s a particular kind of hell to lose someone in this way. The act inflicts more agony.
@SourPatches2077 I remember the first time I heard someone say this about suicide, but life’s taught me suicide is as complex and individual as the person who died. Some mental distress is so acute the mind can’t grasp anything beyond its own agony.

@Jebadoo2 Welcome back 👏👏👏
"For this reason, however, they must live within a lie. They need not accept the lie. It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it.""  12/X

Václav Havel, The Power of the Powerless, 1978"
... to the highest functionary... Individuals need not believe all these mystifications, but they must behave as though they did, or they must at least tolerate them in silence, or get along well with those who work with them.  11/12
...it enables people to deceive their conscience and conceal their true position and their inglorious modus vivendi, both from the world and from themselves. It is an excuse that everyone can use, from the greengrocer, who conceals his fear of losing his job... 10/12
Ideology is a specious way of relating to the world. It offers human beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them. 9/12
It must allow the greengrocer to say, ‘What’s wrong with the workers of the world uniting?’ Thus the sign helps the greengrocer to conceal from himself the low foundations of his obedience... It hides them behind the façade of something high... that something is ideology. 8/12
The greengrocer would be embarrassed and ashamed to put such an unequivocal statement of his own degradation... To overcome this complication, his expression of loyalty must take the form of a sign...  7/12
...if the greengrocer had been instructed to display the slogan, ‘I am afraid and therefore unquestioningly obedient’, he would not be nearly as indifferent to its semantics, even though the statement would reflect the truth.  6/12
...The slogan is really a sign, and as such it contains a subliminal but very definite message... ‘I, the greengrocer XY, live here and I know what I must do. I behave in the manner expected of me... I am obedient and therefore I have the right to be left in peace.’  5/12
If he were to refuse, there could be trouble. He could be reproached for not having the proper ‘decoration’ in his window; someone might even accuse him of disloyalty. He does it because these things must be done if one is to get along in life.  4/12
That poster was delivered to our greengrocer from the enterprise headquarters along with the onions and carrots. He put them all into the window simply... because everyone does it, and because that is the way it has to be.  3/12
Is his enthusiasm so great that he feels an irrepressible impulse to acquaint the public with his ideals? Has he really given more than a moment’s thought to how such a unification might occur and what it would mean?  2/12
A family member who will remain anonymous told me to dip it in water, promising this would somehow make it look better on the cake. I swear to god, it’s a mystery to me how I’ve never been recruited to a cult. https://t.co/3kCgiu6J2C

OK, I was too precipitate, out of gratitude for the donation! As this was an open collection, gift aid can't be claimed. However, I WILL still be matching the kids' donations, so their money WILL be doubled and I remain deeply grateful for their contribution ❤️ https://t.co/BwWZdHRafC
@Cantspekl @naectegale @lumos Fair point. I will check and repost.
Please thank them so much from me, say I think they're completely awesome and that they're going to make a real difference to some of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine. I'll be matching every penny they've given, so their efforts will make twice as much difference! https://t.co/MGTmOgKvmX
@RaffertyCarol @lumos Thank you xxx
For anybody wishing to donate to help children in institutions in Ukraine, who are extremely vulnerable at the moment, @lumos's core costs have been covered and 100% of your donation will go to helping those children.
"1. You are a completely wonderful person.
2. The best way to do this is to pay the cash into a bank account and then use the link
https://t.co/QOkD4a4nod to donate online
3. If the bank account belongs to a UK taxpayer, @lumos can then claim Gift Aid (=more £ for children in 🇺🇦) https://t.co/OjbSDd2GH6"
@SophieXY44 From your lips to the Goddesses' ears, Sophie 😘
@SophieXY44 What's really impressive is that I never came on Twitter 13 years ago, yet you knew I'd arrive eventually, tailored your fake persona accordingly and lay in wait. Bravo, you cunning clairvoyant!

@Baronessjenkin I noticed 🤩
What you and your ilk fail to appreciate is how tediously familiar I find your tactics. I had a violent ex-husband who used to tell me life would be great if only I’d comply, but you’re making the same mistake he did. Women like me can’t be bullied out of resistance. https://t.co/039pBtFtNT

@PennyRed @bindelj Bad reviews are part and parcel of being a writer. If they cause you equivalent trauma to being bombed out of your house or witnessing the murder of loved ones, maybe find a job where dishing it out, but not being able to take it, is a key requirement. 3/3
@PennyRed @bindelj I have the self-awareness to know that however upsetting the death and rape threats your fellow activists throw at me are, there are literally billions of people suffering more than I am. You claim to be suffering PTSD because of *bad book reviews* 2/3
@PennyRed @bindelj Laurie, you’ve been flinging terms like ‘fascist’ and ‘transphobe’ against women who disagree with you for a very long time. I don’t recall you showing the slightest empathy for other women’s trauma while you dismissed their, in my view, reasonable and rational concerns. 1/3 https://t.co/YCv60ogt8x
@viewingfigures @PennyRed @MindCharity Julie Bindel has dedicated her life to protecting and assisting traumatised women. In consequence, she’s only too familiar with what CPTSD is. What she’s mocking is the idea that CPTSD is caused by getting a bad book review… as I suspect you know.
@TSeex @NicolaSturgeon I know what’s in the bill and I know what evidence was presented by women’s groups. Neither are secret.
and those consequences ensue as a result, the @SNP govt can’t pretend it wasn’t warned. 2/2
Multiple women’s groups have presented well-sourced evidence to @NicolaSturgeon’s government about the likely negative consequences of this legislation for women and girls, especially the most vulnerable. All has been ignored. If the legislation is passed 1/2
A few short days after @ShonaRobison claimed there’s no evidence predators have ‘ever had to pretend to be anything else,’ @MhairiHunter tells concerned women that the way to address their concerns is to pass the legislation they have concerns about. https://t.co/EoV40eej6R
@bindelj Thoughts and prayers, Julie.
@judgejules75 @lumos The feeling is entirely mutual 😘
@belballesteros @lumos I support children in all of those places through my separate charitable trust, but @lumos is a charity specifically for children in institutions and during wars, those children become even more vulnerable. Hence the current appeal!
I will personally match donations to this appeal, up to £1m. Thank you so, so much to all who’ve already donated, you’re enabling @lumos to do crucial work for some of the most vulnerable children in Ukraine. https://t.co/XK8yTtB1nl
@Lescoleen67 @WackyPidgeon @HomoLittlest I believe you.
@HomoLittlest Oh, Freddie ❤️❤️❤️
@KSpence88 @ShonaRobison I can't put a heart on that tweet, because it feels wrong. I know from personal experience that these things never leave you, but this comes with a huge hug and a wish for your safety, healing and happiness x
Exactly this. The law @NicolaSturgeon's trying to pass in Scotland will harm the most vulnerable women in society: those seeking help after male violence/rape and incarcerated women. Statistics show that imprisoned women are already far more likely to have been previously abused. https://t.co/LPN8cx1Vf4
The most searing, heartfelt and courageous response yet to @ShonaRobison's astounding claim in the Scottish parliament that there is no evidence sexual predators 'have ever had to pretend to be anything else'. Susan, as a fellow survivor, I salute you. https://t.co/zHmNj29S0b
Apologies if I haven't retweeted your #WorldBookDay picture! There have been a lot, but I've tried to RT as many as possible. When I wrote 'Mr and Mrs Dursley of number four, Privet Drive...' I never dreamed I'd be seeing pictures like these one day. Thank you 🙏⚡️❤️
I've heard stories like this from care experienced children and it makes me so happy to know they see themselves in Harry. After all, it isn't how or where we started, it's where we're going that counts... #WorldBookDay https://t.co/pnH1TJtOAV
