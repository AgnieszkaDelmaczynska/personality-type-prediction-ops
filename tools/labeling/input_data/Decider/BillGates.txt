Although the foundation bears our names, basically half our resources have come from Warren Buffett. His incredible generosity is a huge reason why the foundation has been able to be so ambitious. I can never adequately express how much I appreciate his friendship and guidance. https://t.co/at7MvJKxQv
I am very proud of the foundation’s role in helping solve big problems like preventing pandemics, reducing childhood deaths, eradicating diseases, improving food security and climate adaptation, achieving gender equality, and improving educational outcomes.https://t.co/D8rJrdoPOE
With the support and guidance of our board, we plan to increase our spending from nearly $6 billion per year today to $9 billion per year by 2026. To help make this spending increase possible, I am transferring $20 billion to the foundation’s endowment this month. https://t.co/ybLMAKPx7I
Melinda and I started the @gatesfoundation in 2000 because we believed that every person should have the chance to live a healthy and productive life. That vision remains the same, but the great crises of our time require all of us to do more. https://t.co/QBT6FHMqEj
But I’m still optimistic. These setbacks are happening in the context of two decades’ worth of historic progress and I believe it is possible to mitigate the damage and get back to the progress the world was making.
The pandemic is one of the biggest setbacks in history. The war on Ukraine is a gigantic tragedy for the entire world. The damage from climate change is already worse than most models predicted. The U.S. has taken a huge step backwards for gender equality and women’s health.
Several huge global setbacks over the past few years have left many people discouraged and wondering whether the world is destined to get worse.

Thanks @devisridhar for taking the time today to discuss omicron, vaccines, and how the world can come together to prevent the next pandemic. https://t.co/WY5P7xluwe
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov @trvrb .@DrTedros  has started the conversation about how we avoid the next pandemic which is important. I appreciate your work on this. We can do a lot better next time!!#
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year. @trvrb  tracks the genetics really well. We may have to take yearly shots for Covid for some time.
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov The data is pretty strong that it came from another species which is true for most pandemics. People will continue to speculate on this and we should make sure labs are careful. There will be future outbreaks coming from other species so we need to invest in being ready. #
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals. The pandemic is a huge setback - including rich countries not focusing on the needs of developing countries as much. I hope we can reverse that.
@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov People like you and I and Tony Fauci have been subject to a lot of misinformation. I didn't expect that. Some of it like me putting chips in arms doesn't make sense to me - why would I want to do that?#
@devisridhar @gavi Trusted authorities like @WHO  and @CDCgov need more resources to see the pandemic early (surveillance) and to communicate better. Social media got behind on trying to get factual information out - there will be a lot of debate about how to do better on that...
@devisridhar @gavi Do you think the world will come together to get ready for the next one? I hope so but I am not sure.#
"@devisridhar @gavi Also some countries did a better job of reducing mobility, using masks and protecting the elderly.

We weren't prepared - no practice in advance.#"
@devisridhar @gavi A few countries like Australia moved fast to diagnose cases at scale and isolate people who were infected. They were able to limit deaths dramatically. Once the numbers get large in a country it is too late. So the first few months made a lot of difference.
@devisridhar When we have adequate supply then tiered pricing is used where the rich countries pay a lot more than middle income and low income pay the least which is funded by @gavi. When supply is limited rich countries have to not outbid the others so governments are key to this. #
@devisridhar mRna vaccines still can't meet all the demand so figuring out who gets what is complicated.#
@devisridhar During 2021 the supply of vaccines was limited and they mostly went to wealthy countries. Now we have a lot of supply overall and the problems are logistics and demand. The health systems in developing countries are a limiting factor.
"@devisridhar The vaccines we have prevent severe disease and death very well but they are missing two key things.

First they still allow infections (""breakthrough"") and the duration appears to be limited.

We need vaccines that prevent re-infection and have many years of duration.#"
I'm excited to talk with @DeviSridhar today about her work at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and @GlobalHealthGP, and to answer some of your questions about what we’ve been learning recently about the pandemic. #
Through my foundation work I'm very lucky to have the opportunity to talk to—and learn from—experts in many different fields. Many of my conversations recently have been about the omicron variant and how to prevent the next pandemic. https://t.co/jYR0KjX4Cx

I know it’s frustrating to go into another holiday season with COVID looming over us. But it won’t be like this forever. Someday the pandemic will end, and the better we look after each other, the sooner that time will come.
If there’s good news here, it’s that omicron moves so quickly that once it becomes dominant in a country, the wave there should last less than 3 months. Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022.
There will be more breakthrough cases in people who are vx’d, which sounds concerning but is purely a factor of how many people are vx’d and how fast this variant is spreading. Vaccines are designed to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying &amp; are doing that well.
In the meantime, we all have to look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable, whether they live down the street or in another country. That means wearing masks, avoiding big indoor gatherings, and getting vaccinated. Getting a booster gives the best protection.
The big unknown is how sick omicron makes you. We need to take it seriously until we know more about it. Even if it’s only half as severe as delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because it’s so infectious.
Omicron is spreading faster than any virus in history. It will soon be in every country in the world.
Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic. Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and I’ve canceled most of my holiday plans.

Our funding is only part of the solution. More donors will need to step up to make sure molnupiravir is available to all as quickly as possible.
Everyone deserves equitable access to healthcare. That’s why we engaged partners like @MedsForAll and @OfficialUoM to find more affordable, safe materials that generic manufacturers can use to produce medicines at a lower cost.

Still, the disparities in access to the COVID-19 vaccine are shocking and unjust. Only 2 percent of people in low-income countries have received any COVID-19 vaccines. And the gap may be getting even larger as rich-world governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots.
Inequity in health is not new. Each year, more than 5 million children—almost entirely in low- and middle-income countries—die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundation’s top priority for more than 20 years.
The pandemic has worsened inequities. But it's also shown the world what's possible when we come together. Read why there's reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report. https://t.co/2XUNjdwCyf

Of course, the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs will take years to fully understand, as more and better data becomes available. And this data doesn’t diminish the very real suffering the pandemic has caused for people everywhere—far from it.
Initial projections about the pandemic’s impact on the fight against malaria were dire. But that projection spurred many countries to action to ensure that bed nets were distributed and that testing and antimalarial drugs remained available.
When the pandemic hit, many feared the worst when it came to maintaining progress on fighting other diseases. But all over the world people stepped up to avert the worst-case scenarios. One example is malaria: https://t.co/InzRGXGtyc https://t.co/aM5mszTtWR
Where you live shouldn’t determine whether or not you have access to a Covid-19 vaccine, health supplies, or a diagnostic test: https://t.co/DbwClIBRox https://t.co/eeH7Ezn0Fb
Even amid the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen that progress can continue thanks to work started years earlier. In this year’s #Goalkeepers2030 report, we share some of the lessons that have inspired all of us at the @gatesfoundation. https://t.co/pTc6N1cg4J
This news is not surprising to many of us who work in global health. But there are things the world can do to help get management of these diseases back on track. I’m eager to share more in the annual Goalkeepers report tomorrow. https://t.co/3Q6QE1prmG #Goalkeepers2030
I’m thinking today about the frontline heroes who risked their lives for us on September 11th and those who continue to serve our country every day.
“How do we use technology and innovation to solve today’s problems?” That’s the question David Sengeh, Sierra Leone’s chief innovation officer and education minister, is looking to answer with the country’s National Innovation and Digital Strategy: https://t.co/btg2gPFI4Q https://t.co/EV9zh7Lq0x
The world needs many breakthroughs to get from 51 billion tons of greenhouse gases to zero in order to avoid a climate disaster. It’s encouraging to see this kind of collaboration. https://t.co/wW6ftAL5id
I found the book to be valuable on a number of levels and will have more to say about it soon! https://t.co/Ur2aE81FyV
The first time I met David Sengeh, I was blown away by his intellect, his ambition, and his sense of humor. He has been a remarkable advocate for Sierra Leone, and I’m confident that we’ll be hearing about @dsengeh’s amazing work for decades to come. https://t.co/js7uakLj4m
Africa's success against wild polio last year is one of the most inspiring stories in global health. I’m optimistic that, with the commitment and collaboration that achieved that goal, countries in the region can beat all forms of the virus and #EndPolio https://t.co/lpJsrhAQcf
None of us would be where we are today without the incredible teachers who helped shape our perspectives. Brooke Brown is an extraordinary teacher who has helped her students adapt to extraordinary times. https://t.co/btiQikTyVX
.@GAP_Foundation’s Bio-Hermes Study is the first to compare results of blood and digital biomarker tests with imaging and traditional cognitive tests. This could help identify Alzheimer’s earlier and detect progression of the disease, to help us get closer to a cure. https://t.co/9xUQ0ZldSI
I recently sat down with the extraordinary Brooke Brown, Washington State’s 2021 Teacher of the Year. It was a pleasure to meet with her and take part in one of her favorite lessons: https://t.co/TAwysEihyQ https://t.co/rlB1iJjogC

I’m optimistic about the work that @Breakthrough is doing to invest in companies, support innovators, advocate for better policies, and lower the cost of climate tech. Join us. https://t.co/xlbtvEAqcn
Reaching zero will take a complete transformation of how we make and do everything – from the technologies and products we create to our public policies to the way we use markets to accelerate change. We need a new industrial revolution powered by clean technology.
Every climate action we take must be toward the goal of reaching zero. That means rapidly deploying the technologies we have today to reduce emissions and investing immediately in the solutions we still need to get the world to zero.
Avoiding a disaster will require courage, ambition, and partnership among leaders in every sector around the globe. As the report makes clear, no region will be spared by climate change. It will take all of us to meet this challenge.
Today’s United Nations climate report is an urgent call to action for the world: we must reach net-zero emissions by 2050 to avoid a climate disaster. https://t.co/eSaC2HyD8q

And while COVID-19 will rightfully continue to dominate the agenda, the United States also has the opportunity to lead the world in avoiding a climate disaster. The President is taking a great first step by rejoining the Paris Climate Accord.
The President’s commitment to reengage with the world gives me hope that the recovery will reach everyone, including communities of color in the U.S. and people in poor countries around the world.
With Americans across the country working together, more people get a COVID-19 vaccine every day, bringing us closer to a time when life will look much more like normal. Until then, we can slow the spread of the virus and save lives by continuing to distance and wear masks.
I look forward to working with President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris to tackle some of our toughest challenges like COVID-19 and climate change. This has been a troubling time in America, but I see promise in the months and years ahead.
#MLKDay has long been a national day of service. As we celebrate the first without Congressman John Lewis, I'm thinking about his powerful call to remain hopeful about the future as we work to make our country—and our world—a better place. https://t.co/RpmKvrzjPo

This new quiz from @Gapminder is a clever way to fight misconceptions and “upgrade your worldview” about the incredible progress the world has made toward the Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty, fight inequality, and stop climate change: https://t.co/Qo0oaxv1tb
Rashida Jones and I talked to Yuval Noah Harari about COVID conspiracy theories, the role social media plays in spreading misinformation, and the one lie I choose to believe even though I know it’s not always true: https://t.co/7pzUFsMf5D https://t.co/YEjZaXLTbJ
I believe we can avoid a climate disaster—if we deploy the clean-energy tools we have now wisely, and if we make big breakthroughs that touch every aspect of our physical economy. Creating the National Institutes of Energy Innovation would put us on the right path.
To reduce duplication, focus the government’s efforts, and get the most innovation out of every dollar of funding, we should create a new organization: the National Institutes of Energy Innovation.
We need to revolutionize the world’s physical economy—and that will take, among other things, a dramatic infusion of ingenuity, funding, and focus from the federal government.
This the most important thing the U.S. can do to lead the world in innovations that will solve climate change. https://t.co/LG9uOnM92r
I’m inspired by Quarraisha Abdool Karim and @ProfAbdoolKarim. They are two of the most respected HIV/AIDS researchers in the world. And now they are helping guide the COVID-19 response in South Africa and around the globe. https://t.co/1gBweBAneA #WorldAIDSDay

1. Letting science and innovation lead the way
2. Making sure solutions work for poor countries too
3. Getting started now

https://t.co/p9m1j5QuJ7"

If we make the right decisions now—informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals—we can save lives and get the country back to work. You can read more about my thoughts on #COVID19 on my blog. https://t.co/KN58B8Hs11
In the meantime, frontline health care workers are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle &amp; King County (@KCPubHealth) is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of.
All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.
If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months—the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.
Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them.
There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. https://t.co/qdrr7Qz16r
The federal government needs to step up on testing: far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal.
Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America—which could take 10 weeks or more—no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown.
There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel #coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact. https://t.co/mAa2XWwBIB

Science is giving us the opportunity to improve lives around the world faster than ever before. Today I was honored to give a speech on this subject at the @aaas annual meeting. #AAASmtg https://t.co/03yWD4svD6
This is an incredible story about the power of vaccines. 13 million people are alive today thanks to @Gavi. Here’s how: https://t.co/3Zyw9mIqYu https://t.co/sSOjYB7ZOf
The only way we'll achieve net-zero carbon emissions is if we innovate, deploy, and invest across all sectors. It's encouraging to see companies working to get our planet one step closer. Congratulations to all the winners of the #BreakthroughCanada initiative. https://t.co/zCnwChkTLX
When we first started our foundation, Melinda and I were optimistic about the power of innovation to drive progress. Twenty years later, we’re just as optimistic, and we’re still swinging for the fences: https://t.co/xF4YpnawpN https://t.co/sDxmLHASXr
In our new annual letter, @melindagates and I write about why we think the risks we’ve taken in the first two decades of our foundation have set us up for future progress. https://t.co/c1ewuGXyhl
@rogerfederer @RafaelNadal @Trevornoah Roger’s foundation partners with local NGOs in six countries in southern Africa to improve early learning and basic education. It’s an impressive organization, and I encourage you to consider supporting its work: https://t.co/fQmyFmjvbm
I’m excited to team up with @rogerfederer again for the Match in Africa Friday in Cape Town. Playing alongside Roger is always a thrill, and I can’t wait to face off against @RafaelNadal and @Trevornoah. https://t.co/WMlbBtZwVC
Thank you, Sue, for all of your contributions to our foundation. I look forward to continuing our work together on important health and education projects that will improve lives. https://t.co/5FaDd56GNC

If the world keeps up the fight against these neglected tropical diseases, we can improve the lives of millions of families: https://t.co/Naourwhu9i #WorldNTDDay https://t.co/eRiBlWI4at
The world has only begun to tap into all the ways AI will help people live healthier lives. I’m excited about the launch of @Microsoft’s new AI for Health initiative, which connects researchers and organizations with world-class AI talent and resources. https://t.co/htZZ0YRIfd
I joined @Twitter ten years (and a couple of days) ago. These are some of my favorite tweets. What’s your favorite tweet from the last ten years? https://t.co/wnylJeSG3q
@gavi There are still too many children—many living in some of the hardest-to-reach places on the planet—who aren’t getting basic vaccines. Gavi is the best tool we have to reach them.  #VaccinesWork
For twenty years, @gavi has worked to ensure that every child in the world is protected from preventable diseases. The results are incredible. But their work is far from done. https://t.co/PI6xkfY5fL
I had a fascinating conversation with Vaclav Smil about what bacteria, babies, empires, and economies all have in common: https://t.co/HUE9aiFLZz https://t.co/NBSLul2iMj
It's great to see Microsoft's leadership in this area. Avoiding the worst effects of climate change will require innovation and investment to get us to net zero carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy. https://t.co/plEjWeqdPg
These global health heroes have helped Bangladesh become a model for other countries for how to respond to infectious disease outbreaks: https://t.co/5CEHpFCklp https://t.co/Kl6ADN43ux
It’s encouraging to see these results. Typhoid is especially deadly for young children, and a vaccine like this has the potential to save millions of lives. https://t.co/2CgV8kCLLm
Thanks to the work of this father–daughter dynamic duo, Bangladesh is moving toward a future of fewer disease outbreaks and more children reaching their fifth birthday. https://t.co/mMXuxNnnYf
Solving the world’s toughest challenges—like fighting the worst impacts of climate change—requires lots of new ideas and talented people working across many fields. I’m glad to see this effort to support this important work. https://t.co/eeFpmXtgv9
Progress isn’t always easy to see. These charts show some of the ways that the world is getting better. https://t.co/gIh6czCZPs

Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite thinkers, and I couldn’t wait to get my hands on his new book about the growth of *everything*. https://t.co/3R8UWhEcwb
What’s next for our foundation? I’m particularly excited about what the next year could mean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines. https://t.co/MbjNWPEl5l
I’ve read a lot of books about history over the years, and These Truths by Jill Lepore is the most honest and unflinching account of the American story I’ve ever seen. It’s also one of the most beautifully written. https://t.co/fYfIFLrmrq
Check out my end of year books list (plus a bonus recommendation) on @Likewise. https://t.co/ZE0Sa2ib8u
December is a great time to take stock of everything you’ve done over the last twelve months—including all of the books you’ve read. I found these books to be really clever and engaging. I hope you them find as intriguing as I did: https://t.co/xKdpvoXbvR https://t.co/XZguGFYssO
Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. I even stayed up two nights in a row on occasion–I don’t recommend that. This book taught me a lot about the importance of a better night's sleep. https://t.co/xUthhTyRb6
This new treatment is a gamechanger for millions of people living with HIV in South Africa. I’m optimistic that it could help #EndAIDS around the world. https://t.co/vrvqM9DA3w
I was deeply moved by Tayari Jones’s story of a married couple whose lives get torn apart by an incident of injustice. The book is so well-written that you’ll find yourself sucked into it despite the heavy subject matter. https://t.co/JAhJOFwdOm
Here are two amazing statistics: primary health care interventions could save 60 million lives in low-and middle-income countries and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030: https://t.co/VfDzACwTNu #HealthForAll https://t.co/tQTEyIaQj3
Diane Tavenner had a simple but very ambitious goal: “We wanted to teach kids not just what they needed to get into college, but what they needed to live a good life.” You can read an excerpt from her wonderful new book on my blog. https://t.co/hYwdeNFTPM
I’ve read a lot of great books this year. Here are some I think you’ll enjoy reading over the holidays. https://t.co/YOpc07Qv3T
I'm a big fan of @SiliconHBO and was excited when they asked me to appear in the series finale tonight. #AlwaysBlue https://t.co/kDnM81w8IF
Thank you, Sue, for your extraordinary leadership. Melinda and I are grateful for the opportunity we’ve had to learn with and from you over the past five-and-a-half years, and we wish you and your family the best. https://t.co/VsVPTo731p
I really enjoyed sitting down with @reidhoffman to talk about the role great cofounders and partners have played in my career, like Paul Allen at Microsoft and @melindagates at the Gates Foundation. You can listen to our conversation here: https://t.co/GlFWwylYcI https://t.co/JQjdxFGxle
I was impressed to see the tremendous impact @Gestamp’s apprenticeship program is having on students and their community: https://t.co/VFuOrRM9ms https://t.co/2GkWeB6Ojj
This #WorldAIDSDay, I’m excited about breakthroughs in treating and preventing HIV thanks to organizations like the @GlobalFund. https://t.co/Sm5dUhTR2A
The world has made incredible strides toward ending the AIDS epidemic over the last twenty years, and I’m optimistic that more progress is on the way. Explore the data: https://t.co/uQ05HXrrPL #WorldAIDSDay
At @Gestamp, an auto parts maker in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I saw how the factory is putting high school students on a path to opportunity: https://t.co/EAB1Enj48G https://t.co/3rhl9PSfQt
Dr. LeAndrea Ware is one of the most energetic school leaders I’ve ever met. Her positivity is infectious. It’s no wonder she was recently named the Tennessee principal of the year: https://t.co/wGwZju8qS7 https://t.co/SmZDJNXzvL
We’re getting closer to having a blood test for Alzheimer’s – which could help doctors detect and diagnose the disease earlier: https://t.co/L6m5WYhova https://t.co/AyR2EqyEHO
US education may be the hardest issue our foundation works on. A recent visit to The Howard School in Chattanooga, Tennessee reminded me why it’s also one of the most inspiring. https://t.co/927CwK2imF
You could find wild poliovirus in 125 countries in 1988. Today, it exists in just two. And more than 18 million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralyzed by polio. Here’s why we aren’t done yet: https://t.co/uXZoglQS7Z https://t.co/rY2eMaDReI
The incredible, diverse global partnership that halted wild polio’s spread in Nigeria 3 years ago makes me optimistic we’ll #EndPolio worldwide. https://t.co/Kr3ibLXdmd
Some of our most vital partners in the fight to #EndPolio are philanthropies like @alwaleed_philan, @bloombergdotorg, Tahir Foundation, Dalio Philanthropies &amp; Ningxia Yanbao Charity Foundation. Their support has helped deliver vaccines and protect millions from polio paralysis. https://t.co/w6yUlN1CwX
Even a single child paralyzed by polio is one too many, but I’m optimistic that we will eradicate the disease thanks to the GPEI’s persistence and creativity. https://t.co/olGWetQPSN
In Abu Dhabi this week, the world committed $2.6B to #EndPolio. Thank you @MohamedBinZayed for your leadership in helping push this terrible disease to the brink of eradication. https://t.co/7tr4wNQjRK
@narendramodi .@narendramodi's leadership has been a catalyst to India's progress on improving health, nutrition and ensuring safe sanitation practices for many. @PMOIndia
The more I’ve learned about Alzheimer’s disease, the more I’ve come to admire the volunteers who participate in clinical trials, and their caregivers too. Here’s a way you can help fight Alzheimer’s: https://t.co/isfZoyZFPU https://t.co/rS27wglMOJ
Better tools for collecting and sharing data will help community health workers protect families in the poorest parts of the world.  https://t.co/dVONnMcY4c
Expanding the diversity of therapies in the pipeline and more efficiently recruiting patients for clinical trials will increase our odds of discovering a breakthrough. I’m hopeful it will lead to an intervention that reduces the impact of Alzheimer’s. https://t.co/j8DZbeUp8F
@ewarren I’m always willing to talk about creative solutions to these problems.
@ewarren I greatly respect your commitment to finding ways to address wealth inequality and poverty at home. While we may disagree about some of the ways to get there, we certainly agree we need a lot of smart people committed to finding the path forward.
@ewarren You and the other candidates are having a really interesting conversation on how to solve some of the world’s toughest problems like eliminating global poverty and avoiding a climate disaster (though those issues don’t get talked about as much as they should).
One of the many awful things about watching someone you love struggle with Alzheimer’s is the feeling of helplessness. You keep thinking that there must be something more you can do. Here's one option. https://t.co/TQ1Z0lYCkN
"We have cut the number of child deaths in half over the last 20 years. New tools like these precision maps from 
@IHME_UW will help us cut child mortality in half again by 2030.  https://t.co/9XfRu6WuLK"
Buildings are one of the five areas where we need a lot of innovation if we’re going to avoid a climate disaster. I wrote about one company with a particularly clever approach. https://t.co/OXdxSChPCX
A lot of work remains, but it’s exciting to see positive data on a drug candidate that may alter the course of Alzheimer’s disease. https://t.co/h97EBGqWyJ
I always like to try out a new TV show or two when I’m on the road. What should I watch next? I set up an Ask on @Likewise to collect your recommendations. https://t.co/6Knu7M3wyO
"""This is a solvable problem."" @CarbonCure (which I’ve helped fund through @btenergy Ventures) has developed an innovative way to reduce cement's carbon footprint: https://t.co/9gvmkPGtnT https://t.co/zaqUc3In6R"
One of the best parts of my job is getting to work with some of the world’s most brilliant minds on seemingly intractable problems. Here’s how we’re trying to tackle one of the defining technical challenges of our time. https://t.co/F2Wd8vM4ia
This is one of the most important topics in medicine today: how can we make data more readily available for researchers to look for patterns and identify new pathways for treatment. https://t.co/hcji8sAhmy
The world has made incredible progress toward the goal to #endpolio thanks to partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE. https://t.co/80j0A3MyJg
Melinda and I feel pressure to make every dollar and every day count, which is why we say no to a lot more opportunities than we say yes to. Working with partners around the world to #EndPolio has been a fight worth every dollar. https://t.co/a3gcP3M2HV
Tackling the world’s toughest health challenges requires the best that science has to offer. Thank you to @NIHDirector and @WHOAFRO for your partnership. https://t.co/85nrN9FFS2
Congrats to the 2019 winners of the @NobelPrize in chemistry! Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery, and the quest to build a better one is an important step in the fight against climate change. https://t.co/8XrKz2Zw1s
Malnutrition is the single greatest health inequity in the world. In its 2019 State of the World’s Children report, @UNICEF takes a critical look at how we can help everyone reach their full potential by improving access to nutrition. https://t.co/rpwu3XuuGt
The world’s poorest people often rely on farming both to feed their families and to earn an income. They will be among the first to face the effects of climate change. I’m excited about innovations aimed at addressing this problem: https://t.co/H7KrSXFo4b https://t.co/1QJg3gyJZY
Congrats to Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer for winning this year’s @NobelPrize in economics. I’ve learned a lot from their pioneering work to better understand the complexities of the lives of the world’s poorest people. https://t.co/Uc0XeytGRs
The world is facing a crisis at the dinner table, one that climate change will only worsen. I’m optimistic about the progress being made by @RIPEproject on a much-needed breakthrough. https://t.co/pzM61gDdWE
The odds of dying of AIDS in South Africa are less than half what they were at the peak. That progress wouldn’t have been possible without the @GlobalFund and other global health organizations. Even more progress is possible if we keep up the fight: https://t.co/71W2exSVZT https://t.co/f2gJwuIb9H
We need more approaches to stopping #Alzheimers disease. I’m excited to see this news out of @DZNE_de and @ISD_Research about a promising starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies. https://t.co/zj81EbL7X6
I’m impressed by the international cooperation that made this year’s @GlobalFund Replenishment round possible. The world has committed more than ever before. Our foundation is proud to commit $700 million to over the next 3 years. #StepUptheFight https://t.co/mfuamNyygd
I can’t think of a more fitting tribute to Hans Rosling and his life’s work. Hans was a dear friend to Melinda and me – and inspired us all with his passion, intelligence, and wit. https://t.co/gYfioNQBuW
I’m in Lyon, France for the @GlobalFund’s replenishment – celebrating the most money ever raised for their life-saving work. I’m excited for the day that these diseases are in the history books. #StepUptheFight https://t.co/isnpGkyNWE
In Afghanistan, one of the last countries with polio, vaccine acceptance rates have reached 98% thanks to the tireless work of female health workers. Their increased involvement and passion is why polio eradication is within reach in Afghanistan. https://t.co/v2yPVeSCiz
If all countries in the world had the same concentration of researchers as wealthy ones, there would be 3x as many researchers. That’s mind-blowing. We all lose out when talent isn’t connected with opportunity. @OurWorldInData https://t.co/a9m56tDdLp
Malnutrition is the greatest health inequity in the world. I recently spoke with my friend @AlikoDangote about how we can use iodized salt to help kids gets the nutrients they need: https://t.co/PXp3WeJfEy https://t.co/qpQ51LWZuf
I’m lucky to have known Stephen Hawking — and he was as exceptional in person as you imagined he was. As remarkable as his contributions to physics were, his biggest accomplishment was inspiring the world to believe in the magic of science and research. https://t.co/FxiyzmBTuz
