Their experiences and wisdom can lead us to a better future if we’re open to receive it. What makes their stories even more poignant, is that young Black journalists and photographers captured their words and images in a spectrum of Black excellence.

It’s his job to help connect the current lives of young children to the souls and minds they left behind. And that’s what he’s trying to help Fawzi do: Process the trauma, find the good memories, and transform this traumatic experience into something good.
Enter Dr. @essamdaod, a child psychiatrist working with kids of Syrian refugees with his international aid organization @HumanityCrew. He believes that when you escape your troubled home, it’s not only your body that suffers and is in need of a doctor, but also your mind. https://t.co/ixR4XIh5Z9
Now, he doesn’t like to think about it because it makes him cry, and he thinks the solution is to try and forget his brother. He’s experiencing trauma, but he’s too young to even know it...let alone have the tools to process it.
He’s experienced a lot in his 11 years on Earth, but the most traumatic experience was his brother being killed in a playground bombing. Fawzi and his mother ran to look for his brother when they found out but he had been blown to pieces.
The Me You Can’t See: Fawzi, suffering from childhood trauma. After trying to flee war-filled Syria three times by boat, Fawzi finally made it to a remote refugee camp in Greece.

Now, he’s realized that in order to finally be free, he has to rip the mask off—so he’s going to therapy, no matter how hard it may be. Thank you, Rashad. I see you.
You go to church, take it to God, and everything will be just fine. But dealing with all of his pain on his own made him lose his passion for cooking; to this day, he can’t even watch his episode of Chopped because he was in so much internal pain while filming the show.
He was taught to push it all down, put on a mask, smile, and fake it, even when he was feeling completely broken inside. Because he says in much of the Black community, therapy is taboo, speaking to a therapist was out of the question.
The Me You Can’t See: Rashad, living with depression and anxiety. Rashad says he’s seen a lot of things in his life, from his house being raided as a kid to his dad going to jail—and all that childhood trauma led him to a place of depression. https://t.co/B5aVF6Pf5i

There are various types of OCD, but Ginny’s specifically manifests in a fear of contamination. The feeling of disgust is so unpleasant and intolerable that it feels like it’ll last forever, so she tries to get rid of that uncomfortable feeling.

She’s learned to pull herself out of dark places with the help of doctors, medicine, and coping mechanisms—and happened to win an Oscar during that process. Now, instead of locking away that experience, she’s trying to give back by sharing it. Thank you, Stefani. I see you.
Through the years, this trauma remained unprocessed, resulting in Stefani cutting herself, experiencing a psychotic break, and finally being diagnosed with PTSD after going to the hospital for chronic pain.
The Me You Can’t See: Stefani Germanotta. While getting her start in the music industry at 19, Stefani was told by a producer to take off her clothes and threatened to have her music burned when she didn’t comply. She was raped. https://t.co/SpZXHCudl7

Watch our story on #TheMeYouCantSee, available now on @AppleTV+: https://t.co/cgPvZazbtf
My 17-year relationship with Alex has caused me to look at mental health in a very different way than I had approached it before. I am very proud of her for sharing her truth, creating a better life for herself, and rising to her best self every single day.
Because of her traumatic upbringing, Alex was diagnosed with PTSD, something I was not equipped to handle. I’ve tried in many ways to help her, but I know now that PTSD is not something that just goes away; it's a lifelong journey, and we’re both learning.
All she needed was someone to believe in her, so I gave her my number and a scholarship—and we’ve been in each other’s lives ever since. What I didn’t know then was that I was stepping into something I did not understand.
The Me You Can’t See: Me and Alex. Many people don't remember that one of the people featured in that episode was a homeless girl by the name of Alex. In spite of everything that life had thrown her way, she still persevered and finished school. https://t.co/BaAMFbVLIt
The Me You Can See: Me giving away cars. For over 17 years, that famous episode of me shouting “You get a car!” to deserving people in my studio audience has followed me. Videos, gifs, memes—you name it, I’ve seen it. https://t.co/nMA79JYnQY

This is one of his last interviews we recently did during the Covid quarantine about his new @JohnLewisDoc #GoodTrouble. Thank you for showing us and teaching us what getting into “good trouble” looks like. 🙏🏽
I know for sure he heard me. I felt good about that. He understood and was so gracious.
I had a final chance to tell him what I’ve said every time I’ve been in his presence: “Thank you for your courage leading the fight for Freedom. My life as it is would not have been possible without you.”
Another “Great Tree” has fallen. Rev C.T. Vivian died today after 95 years. I recall in the ‘80s and ‘90s having him on the Oprah Show many times trying to break down racial barriers. He was a powerful “drum major for justice.” And such a good and gentle man. https://t.co/AqAtuScqT5

“I want all the Karens to unite…Call your manager about justice. Call somebody up about the things you want done. Take that on for yourself and stand in between what we want and the problem and kind of getting in its face.”- @ava #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/5CkmmAz6pw
.@staceyabrams understands more than anyone on this panel that voter suppression is real or else we’d be referring to her as Governor Abrams today. Her ask from this moment? “Vote like your life depends on it because as we see every day, it does.” #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/ZwLA0VvUOi
.@DrIbram is the author of “How to be an Antiracist,” a book that is sold out and backordered because so many people have ordered it. His ask to move us forward: Build an anti-racist America. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/vU0caKhgcb
#DavidOyelowo pointed out that Emmett Till’s death was the precursor to the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ask was about segregation. Bloody Sunday was the precursor to the Selma March and the ask was voting rights. The ask for George Floyd’s death is police reform. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/ecseN9CQj4
“I don't want you to be out in these streets because you’re embarrassed. I don't want you to be out in these streets cause you’re JUST against cruelty but not for my FULL equality. I want you to be ALL the way in with both feet.” - @CharlesMBlow #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/tu3Ey92bHC
“There’s a way in which color blindness is offered to White Americans as a way to fight injustice but it actually promotes that injustice.” – Dr. Jennifer Eberhardt #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/J5aiMiK1xt
“The beauty of this moment is that we’re even discussing it and we’re having a real discussion about what it means. And even how people can have that privilege and be completely oblivious to being empowered by that privilege.” - @KeishaBottoms #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/Zn2x1RqvM9
White privilege is a difficult term to grasp for white people, especially for the middle class and working class folks, because the word privilege is associated with affluence. @nhannahjones breaks it down. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/r40Gd3Wz45
Join me tonight at 9|8c on @OWNTV or on my Facebook page at 10|9c.
How can we move forward? So on part two of my #OWNSpotlight special, “Where Do We Go From Here?” we’ll be discussing what white privilege really is and what we want as a result of this moment (like Atlanta Mayor @KeishaBottoms is explaining here).
We’re going through a reckoning right now &amp; it’s not only about police violence against Black people, but the systemic racism that’s rooted in the soul of our country. For the first time it feels like people are waking up &amp; recognizing that, but in this moment, will we do better? https://t.co/Maj7ux9UfQ
@life_is_red_10 You know my heart,  do you? 🙏🏾

"“If your concern with the murder of Black people by police can be deterred or shifted because someone is taking a pair of jeans from a Target, then you’ve got to look at how much you cared about the murder of the Black people by the police to begin with.""- @ava #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/3zSeEUrv3r"
.@RevDrBarber explains how all the Black lives lost to COVID-19 and George Floyd’s death have led to this collective worldwide gasp. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/L8w6Mo4Jmz
.@staceyabrams addresses how the confluence of events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to the awakening in this moment. And we must meet it. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/ndybka9KDD
.@KeishaBottoms is the Mayor of ATL where over 50% of the population is Black. Last week she stepped into the national spotlight when she said, “I am a mother of four black children in America…When I saw the murder of George Floyd, I hurt like a mother would.” #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/1dWdiGrxJy
.@rashadrobinson is the President of @ColorOfChange, the nation’s largest online racial justice organization. He reminds us that many times we hit moments where we get a lot of attention but not a lot of change, so we need to leverage this to actually make good. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/vy6V2HFZ1g
There’s this memory we all have of Black people being lynched and being dragged through the town as an example. So when we see Black men being shot on camera and nothing happens, it retraumatizes us. Dr. Jennifer Eberhardt explains further. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/DnFwcEzMuY
“We're just tired as black people of having to prove our humanity only when the most inhumane thing happens to us.” - @nhannahjones #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/JloCmMfy1B
After seeing the video of George Floyd, #DavidOyelowo passed his son’s bedroom and heard him crying over it. Although he’s had THE TALK many Black parents have had with their children about interacting with the police, he couldn't find the words in that moment. #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/Mw77gf3vuU
".@charlesmblow is a NYT columnist &amp; he recently wrote in an op-ed, “We must also recognize that to have to live in a world, in a society, in which you feel that your very life is constantly under threat because of the color of your skin is also a form of violence."" #OWNSpotlight https://t.co/rZp75lRr8s"
Join me tonight for an #OWNSpotlight special, “Where Do We Go From Here?” at 9|8c on @OWNTV or on my Facebook page at 10|9c.
Will people recognize systemic racism for the problem and evil that it is? Where do we go from here? So I’m gathering critical thinkers (like @ava) that match their words with actions because that’s what we need: ACTION.
I’ve been talking about racism on TV now for over 35 years, but I don’t recall a moment quite like this one. And just like many of you, I’ve been talking with friends and I noticed the same questions kept coming up: Is this the moment that will finally change our country? https://t.co/V2ks01WPwS

@ARRAYNow @ava @feliciapride @thisthatchloe Y’all WROTE that thing! I’m still 😢#QueenSugar
@iamaniesia This is what I look like right now I am  my own crying Gif watching. #QueenSugar
@SikuthaniMeg For sure. Especially for children. #QueenSugarTalks
@NefertariNkenge @IyanlaVanzant @ARRAYNow @DjentuhPeter @rashadrobinson But don’t you think trauma informed conversations mvmnt are at least an acknowledgement of what happened to you? Which is a much better question than “what’s wrong with yoy
@OOOhTwit Or how about getting whipped as a child and then told “you better stop that cryin’ and put that lip in”! #QueenSugarTalks
@ava @culturejedi You gon’ have lots of T-shirts after this session.👊🏽🙌🏾#QueenSugarTalks
@avaduvernayfans You are so right. Straight up child abuse, is happening daily at the border. And no matter what happens next, those children are changed forever because of it. #QueenSugarTALKS
The most powerful lesson I ever heard on Trauma came from @IyanlaVanzant ” Until you heal the wounds of your past, you will continue to bleed.”That’s what we’re witnessing even when we don’t recognize it. Folks bleeding out thru, drugs, alcohol, rage, et all! #QueenSugarTalks
This was one of my favorite moments because it speaks volumes of truth about all trauma. #QueenSugarTALKS https://t.co/ttNkDxtEHk
Looking forward to this conversation tonight hosted by ⁦@ava⁩. Almost everyone has experienced some spectrum of Trauma. If you didn’t get what you needed to make you whole.. it leaves a hole! https://t.co/0yXHwPmaVW
Couldn’t wait to wake up and get started on the   #1619Project. @nhannahjones and @NYTmag  colleagues. I stand in tearful, joyful, thankful applause for this profound offering to our Culture and our Nation.  Take your bows y’all.
For this month’s “The OG Chronicles,” we got quizzed on how well we know the current slang words used by millennials. @gayleking knew most of them but it’s okay because you can’t slang shame me. All I know is that JOMO is my new favorite term! https://t.co/0VDsEvGx9A

That’s why when @octarell  pitched @davidmakesman to me, I had to listen—and it was the best pitch I ever heard. Watch tomorrow 8/14 at 10|9c on @OWNTV #DavidMakesMan https://t.co/y7gGao6I58
