I have so much respect for Tammy Wynette and her legacy was what kept me going through all the ‘bad times’, the ‘good times’ and all of filming #GeorgeAndTammy I can’t wait for you all to see the rest of the series!
"Thank you @goldenglobes for today’s nomination!!!! I am so happy and honored that you recognized #GeorgeAndTammy today.
💛 Stand By Your Man was such a pivotal moment in Tammy’s career and I was beyond nervous to sing it. Here’s a little bts of that moment. https://t.co/xq5wjd1hfY"

"So yeah, don’t believe the clickbait headlines. I would have just ignored them myself but I have too much respect for Tammy Wynette and her legacy to let it slide.
Anyway, hope you’re enjoying episode 2 titled….. STAND BY YOUR MAN https://t.co/Qiarmjm6jc"
I’ve said multiple times that the song is about standing by someone and forgiving them through difficulty. Doesn’t mean you need to stay married to them, proven by Tammy herself. I love the song. Grateful that I got to learn beyond the stereotype and see it the way Tammy did.
"FYI
I have never said that I was personally offended by the lyrics of Stand By Your Man. Any article stating otherwise is just trying to get clicks."

2 simple ways you can help: 1) share any posts you see about what is happening in Iran. This will put a spotlight on the atrocities of the regime. 2) show your support by signing the petitions that are circulating. There’s 1 on https://t.co/YxEQ4DF7nz against the mandatory hijab.

I hope in the future to work in The West End but for now I can’t wait to be together with all of the wonderful people of New York and my artistic community on Broadway.
So I couldn’t be happier to play Nora in A Doll’s House on Broadway! I’m very excited to work with Jamie and the incredible Amy Herzog in this city that formed me.
While home in NY, walking around the empty theater district made my heart hurt. New York has been my home for over 20 years and it’s immensely important to me to take care of this city and support my artist neighbors, who all struggled while our theaters were closed for so long.
"When I sat down with the brilliant Jamie Lloyd 5 years ago to discuss a possible collaboration, I was over the moon when we decided on A Doll’s House. 

We were set to start rehearsals in London in April 2020, but little did we know what the world (and a pandemic) had in store. https://t.co/nOtqh3KdEr"

But the people of Iran will not be silenced."

Many had been displaced from their homes and spent months in the hospital. It is a huge humanitarian crisis going on in Ukraine. We can’t forget the innocent ones effected by senseless acts of violence. I am grateful to have met these sweet little kids with big brave hearts
One of the experiences from this life changing trip was my visit to the children’s hospital: Ohmatdyt. I had the opportunity to meet incredible children and the director, Volodymyr Zhovnir. The children amazed me with their hope and strength.
I needed a few weeks to process everything I saw from my trip to Kyiv. We landed in Poland, drove 4 hrs then took a train for another 11. I was nervous and the length of the journey gave me time to calm myself. I’m going to now start sharing with you guys what I saw. https://t.co/fFsloiBwuw

This idea of reminding us what it is like when one group loses their rights – it’s a trickle-down effect. It affects everyone, and so I think the stories I start looking at will have to deal with that.”
In some sense, we’ve taken for granted this idea, of being able to live a life free of violence and someone else making decisions about your welfare, your safety…

@KateAurthur Inviting a journalist to spend that much time with you and your children is very rare. It’s a level of trust that I (rightly) do not have when it comes to media. I see what get clicks. It’s usually negative headlines. Wish we could move beyond it as it feels predictable and tired
@KateAurthur Hi Kate, I read them when I can. I have to disagree with the nuanced description. I spend a lot of time with Jeremy and his family. This article in no way represents the man he is. All the quotes chosen felt ‘cherry picked’ to create the image the writer was putting forward.
In defence of Jeremy Strong: why attack him for taking his job so seriously?  https://t.co/BnTLTK5Rnz

The way she celebrated her family has been very meaningful to see over the years. My heart goes to her beloved Richard and Oilly. You were always her North Star.
We worked together on The Debt, Poirot, Coriolanus, Miss Julie, Crimson Peak, The Zookeeper’s Wife, &amp; The 355. Every day I was excited to go to work and giggle with Joan. She was a barometer of truth with a wicked sense of humor. I loved her very much.

HOLD YOURSELF ACCOUNTABLE: Require officers to report each time they use force or threaten to use force against civilians. https://t.co/8xWqRXtwuh
Develop a Force Continuum that limits the types of force and/or weapons that can be used to respond to specific types of resistance. https://t.co/p4NSGY6u5F
Restrict officers from shooting at moving vehicles, which is regarded as a particularly dangerous and ineffective tactic. https://t.co/V6Bqdy6U9L
THIS is super important to me, as humans we must stand up for what is right, even if it puts us in a difficult situation with our colleagues: Require officers to intervene and stop excessive force used by other officers and report these incidents immediately to a supervisor. https://t.co/qePcsvfWoj
Require officers to exhaust all other reasonable means before resorting to deadly force. https://t.co/Y5zHkGajtY
Require officers to give a verbal warning, when possible, before shooting at a civilian https://t.co/XRA61p941g
Require officers to de-escalate situations, where possible, by communicating with subjects, maintaining distance, and otherwise eliminating the need to use force. https://t.co/ETdDU4kkSH
Allowing officers to choke or strangle civilians, in many cases where less lethal force could be used instead, results in the unnecessary death or serious injury of civilians. https://t.co/5Zx4WJZ3EY
