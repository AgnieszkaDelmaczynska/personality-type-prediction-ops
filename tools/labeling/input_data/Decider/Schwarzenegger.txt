Go out, find a veteran, and buy them a coffee or a meal. And if you don‚Äôt have money, just sit down and have a real conversation. All of you can have an impact. Once you actually do something, then can post about that and inspire others. https://t.co/pl3ZWXgpQZ
This Veteran‚Äôs Day, thank a veteran. I mean, really thank one. No bullshit. I mean more than posting a flag on social media and saying ‚Äúthank you for your service.‚Äù https://t.co/2hrdimUgAh

James Madison said: ‚ÄúYou must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place, oblige it to control itself.‚Äù These legislators want an uncontrollable government, and the Court shouldn‚Äôt give it to them. 4/4
They should be asked to take the same citizenship test I took in 1983 so they can be reminded of the separation of powers and checks and balances that stand as the foundation of our fantastic country. 3/4
First, legislators draw district lines to lock in legislative incumbents so the people have no recourse at the ballot box, and then they tell us that only the state legislature, which they have now made certain the people can‚Äôt throw out in fair elections, can change the law. 2/4
"This is my amicus brief in Moore v. Harper, the test of the so-called independent state legislature theory at the Supreme Court. You have to be polite at SCOTUS, but here are my unfiltered thoughts. Frankly, this theory is nuts. 1/4

When you see a chance to make an impact, to leave a better world for the next generation, I hope you‚Äôll think about Mikhail Gorbachev and ask yourself, ‚ÄúIf not me, who? If not now, when?‚Äù I know I will.
He belongs to history now, and I know he‚Äôs overjoyed to be reunited with his dear Raisa, once again living one of the greatest love stories of all time.
He did exactly that in the old Soviet Union. He will be remembered for all time as a hero who dismantled the communist system despite what it meant for his own power.
Imagine rising to the very top of any organization, and then having the wisdom AND the courage to look around and say, ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt work for the people, someone has to fix it. If not me, who? If not now, when?‚Äù
There‚Äôs an old saying, ‚ÄúNever meet your heroes.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs some of the worst advice I‚Äôve ever heard. Mikhail Gorbachev was one of my heroes, and it was an honor and a joy to meet him. I was unbelievably lucky to call him a friend. All of us can learn from his fantastic life. https://t.co/All5suSke1

Today my mother, Aurelia, would have been 100. She was the best mother you can imagine and I‚Äôll always love her. I can‚Äôt explain how much she meant to me, but she is the number one reason I won‚Äôt call myself self-made. https://t.co/jCXSdx9S2N
The best way any of us can honor Bob‚Äôs unbelievable life is to remember that there is always someone out there waiting for a door to be opened to their dreams, and each of us has the power to let them in like Bob did over and over throughout his fantastic career.
He saw something the others didn‚Äôt, and he helped make my dream into a reality. He was a fantastic director, teacher, mentor, and friend. I‚Äôm so grateful that I got to work with him and get to know him.
Bob¬†Rafelson was a genius and a visionary. I‚Äôve talked for years about how agents, producers, &amp; directors laughed me and my dreams of being an actor out of their offices. It was Bob who finally opened the door to Hollywood and let me in with ‚ÄúStay Hungry.‚Äù

"""No matter how you look at it, we have blood on our hands. Right now, we have all the technology we need to leave fossil fuels in the past. We have a moral obligation to use it."""
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not whether we need to move forward, it‚Äôs how quickly we move forward.‚Äù -@EPAMichaelRegan

Vitali and Wladimir @Klitschko, I am thinking of you, my friends. You were my heroes in the ring and you‚Äôre my heroes now. https://t.co/hR5U5llTwS
In the meantime, I stand with the people of Ukraine. I share your grief and your hope for peace. You inspire me with your bravery and your humanity in the face of this nightmare. God bless you.
I hope sanity will eventually prevail and end this unnecessary war before too many lives are broken.
I have Ukrainian friends and fans and I have Russian friends and fans. As far as I can tell, none of them want this.
War has a way of breaking the winners along with the losers.
I am not a foreign policy expert, so I will leave the analysis to smarter people than me. I do know what it‚Äôs like to grow up after a war, in an occupied country, and I know that in war and its aftermath, no one wins. Everyone suffers.
My thoughts are with the Ukrainian people. I have been asked to do several interviews, but I believe the news should continue to focus on what‚Äôs happening on the ground - on the tragedy that has broken our hearts and on the courage of the Ukrainian people that has inspired us.

"Solar gives people a sense of self-sufficiency and independence from the grid. Is it any surprise that the big utilities want to take that away?

Stop the solar tax. Read my piece in the ‚Å¶@nytimes‚Å©. https://t.co/ypURexjR3J"

Yes! Thank you to Chief Justice O‚ÄôConnor and the Ohio Supreme Court for putting the voters first. After seeing how the legislators completely ignored the will of 75% of Ohio voters, I agree, it is time for a fully independent, non-partisan commission. https://t.co/3MKqfsMENQ
Thank you for being a public servant, not a party servant @LarryHogan. We need to terminate gerrymandering in Maryland and all over the country. America has had enough of the gridlock that is caused by politicians picking their voters instead of voters picking their politicians. https://t.co/ztrIdlY9Zs
This year, I‚Äôve asked my institute, @GovArnoldUSC, to really focus on the foundations of the anger fueled by lies we saw boil over a year ago &amp; solutions to the gridlocked partisanship of Washington. These three ideas are just a start, because they‚Äôre the issues I know and love.
3. Restore the Voting Rights Act. This shouldn‚Äôt be partisan. In 2006, under Bush, the VRA was renewed with a 98-0 Senate vote. If you‚Äôre afraid of voters voting, find a new job.
2. Open up our primaries. It is ludicrous that so many states still have a low-turnout election where the extremes decide the candidates. Open primaries move politicians to the center, where the people are.
"Here‚Äôs a training plan for our democracy:

1. Terminate gerrymandering. When the same people get re-elected every two years despite not doing anything, of course the people are angry. Like Reagan said, politicians picking their voters is anti-democratic and un-American."
"Never forget where lies and anger lead.

I know in my heart that our country is better than what happened a year ago. But I also know the American experiment isn‚Äôt passive. It only works if we work. We are only better if we fight to be better. Democracy isn‚Äôt a spectator sport. https://t.co/uI9Ohy8UlL"
Absolutely! Thank you for being such a democracy action hero. https://t.co/fmI0QUTX8B
I was proud to campaign with reformers like Katie Fahey, who changed her state for the better. Katie should inspire anyone who is frustrated with our politics, because she didn‚Äôt just complain - she got off the couch and did something about it. You terminated gerrymandering! https://t.co/vFeFVZH8O7
Congratulations to the Michigan Independent Redistricting Commissioners. Yesterday a bipartisan vote created fair districts for the state's voters. You proved that when the people, not the politicians, draw the lines, the voters win.
@RexChapman üí™ Thanks for sharing and reminding everyone that we all have the power to give back and spread positivity. https://t.co/cpLm4IUkoM
This is what Christmas is all about. All of you have the power to do something for someone else this holiday season. It doesn‚Äôt have to be big. Just give a few minutes of your time to help someone else. https://t.co/xHiKKRPOh7
I want to thank @VillageforVets for arranging the homes, @SecVetAffairs, @AMVETSHQ and everyone who talked with us and worked with us and made this possible. We proved that when we all work together, we can solve any problem.
Today, I celebrated Christmas early. The 25 homes I donated for homeless veterans were installed here in LA. It was fantastic to spend some time with our heroes and welcome them into their new homes. https://t.co/2mHKfoZ65V
Open. Non-partisan. Unanimous. You all led the way and showed the country the benefits of terminating gerrymandering.
5 Republicans, 5 Democrats, and 4 independents unanimously voted for California's redistricting maps. I am proud of the California Citizens Redistricting Commission for serving as a model for how this should be done in every state. @WeDrawTheLines
Last night, 14 CA citizens showed they are democracy action heroes. The California Citizens Redistricting Commission worked together across party lines to unanimously support California‚Äôs new redistricting maps. They listened to the people, not the politicians. @WeDrawTheLines

Happy birthday @KSchwarzenegger ! I love you so, so much. You changed my life when you came into this world and it‚Äôs been better ever since - being a father, and now a grandfather, is just the best role in the world. I know you‚Äôll have another amazing year. https://t.co/9GuzafHiGd

I also want to thank reporters like @jonathanweisman for covering this subject. The drawing of district lines isn‚Äôt sexy or good clickbait, but it‚Äôs vital for our democracy that the people understand their leaders are fixing the system against them. https://t.co/agYe8B767d
I will continue this crusade for fair districts through @GovArnoldUSC until we terminate gerrymandering everywhere.  The constitution says ‚ÄúWe the people,‚Äù not ‚ÄúWe the politicians‚Äù &amp; our politicians should have to deliver for the people to keep their jobs. https://t.co/agYe8B767d
As with everything in my life, this success was not self-made. The politicians from both parties fought us, but we had great reform partners in @CommonCauseCA, @LWV, @AARP. And the people voted to end the 200 year old system of gerrymandering. https://t.co/agYe8B767d
In the decade since our independent commission drew the lines, 16 seats changed party hands. I know from my bodybuilding career that competition creates performance. The politicians will always draw lines to protect themselves. We need reform nationwide. https://t.co/agYe8B767d
When I became Governor and saw that over 10 years, only 1 seat in CA‚Äôs congressional delegation changed party hands, I wanted change. It was a fixed system. I am so proud we took the power of drawing lines from politicians and gave it to the people. https://t.co/agYe8B767d
@WholesomeMeme Thanks for sharing. The best part of this was watching the original poster start inspiring other people in the thread, and that they continue to spread the motivation to this day.

I was in heaven. He couldn‚Äôt have been more welcoming, and he always pushed everyone around him in the gym to be better. He was an amazing writer and a great family man. I will miss the Blond Bomber, but his memory will always be with me. My thoughts are with Laree and the family
When I got to America and finally met Dave, I learned his heart was as big as his pecs. He even hand-built my first furniture when I moved to Santa Monica, and man, he was talented. Can you imagine meeting your idol, becoming his training partner and traveling the world together?
Dave Draper was an inspiration to millions of people all over the world, including me. He was one of my idols. In Austria, I kept his photo on the wall above my bed for motivation, and when I saw him starring in ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Make Waves‚Äù, I thought,My dreams are possible.‚Äù https://t.co/pSse0tS219

Let‚Äôs once again honor the memory of the heroes of that day by proving we can come together to keep this nation the greatest in the world.
Those evil bastards tried their best to divide us, and they failed. We were resilient - our towers and our fellow Americans fell - but in testament to them, we rose, together.
How can we help find the purpose and the unity we felt? How can each of us, in our own way, serve the United States? How can we unite, once again?
We found our way to the light and mended our hearts through our unity. We must never forget the pain or the purpose. We owe it to the people who lost their lives and the heroes who charged into danger to ask ourselves today, and every day, what can we do for our fellow Americans?
Today we mourn the victims and honor the heroes of a day that darkened our skies and broke our hearts 20 years ago.

This synagogue was destroyed by the Nazis during Kristallnacht, but the next generation rebuilt it right on top of the old brick foundation that you can see in this photo.

Starting today, you can sign up for my guided Celebrity Walks on the @MyOpenfit app for a low-impact and fun walking workout with entertainment and motivation from me in your ear as you walk and schvitz a little. #WalkWithArnold #EveryStep
When @MyOpenfit acquired Ladder and we became partners and I heard about their Every Step walks where people pump each other up while they burn calories, I knew I had to be involved. https://t.co/UFTFvdEMco
People ask me all the time how to start getting in shape. I always say it starts with the first step. You move more than you did yesterday, you walk a little farther and then you celebrate your success. Eventually the small victories you‚Äôre celebrating will become huge victories.
I got together with my good friend @GretaThunberg again to talk about people power. Tune in to Arnold‚Äôs Stammtisch this morning for more! https://t.co/IapIkva2xR https://t.co/A4Wqph4kOF
You will be shocked to learn that the ozone problem didn‚Äôt just go away - an American President took action and signed an international agreement to help solve it. You might be more shocked it was a Republican, one of my heroes, President Reagan. https://t.co/piqKjklmoS https://t.co/1GXYc0VWKJ
I am not a fan of the doom and gloom we often hear at environmental conferences. That‚Äôs why I was so pumped to meet Troy, an oil worker in Bakersfield who transitioned into solar. Listen to our stammtisch and you‚Äôll feel hopeful for the jobs of the future. https://t.co/CT8QvC0ngQ

You are a champion! Thank YOU for giving people hope and change. https://t.co/GjeQ5puXz6
It‚Äôs easy to tweet and complain. It‚Äôs hard to create change. The Schwarzenegger Institute is all about common sense change and that‚Äôs why we stand with Erroll.
As a former law enforcement officer, he has a unique perspective. And when he explained that officers can lose their jobs for doing horrible things and then immediately get hired in another department, I saw the wisdom of the LEWIS Registry.
Last year I wrote in @TheAtlantic that we need to listen, learn, and do the hard work of reform. Erroll was the first person I called when I wanted to learn, because his story about worrying about his son every time the phone rang at night broke my heart. https://t.co/2uI9fv2IXk
This week was the anniversary of George Floyd‚Äôs tragic murder. I‚Äôve always believed talk is cheap, so when my friend @esouthersHVE proposed the common sense reform of a database of police officers fired for misconduct, I immediately offered my support. https://t.co/Yi29qUnVzL
Isaac is a fantastic journalist and I love reading all of his stories because he knows how to dig in and get information no one else can. I can‚Äôt wait to read the book, @IsaacDovere. Buy it here: https://t.co/Txr1sepZvM https://t.co/gymksD89ss

When I moved to this country, I had a lot of big dreams, but I never dreamed that one day I would be painted by a President. Thank you for your fantastic book, Out of Many, One, @TheBushCenter, and thank you for painting me and all of these exceptional immigrants. https://t.co/mziuMO5H5b

A stammtisch is the regular‚Äôs table at a bar or restaurant in Austria. It‚Äôs a place where locals can have open conversations. Over the next few months, I‚Äôll be hosting environmental leaders in informal conversations! This is the first of many.
LIVE NOW: My first stammtisch leading up to our @ArnoldSCI Austrian World Summit. I‚Äôm talking to by good friend @JimCameron about the environment: https://t.co/uMwjiu9uiS

Nancy is a democracy action hero and it was my honor to meet her and see her passion for all of the voters of Muscogee County. https://t.co/yYlsPsuLQZ
After years of pushing for a Clean Fuel Standard in Washington, the time for action is now. HB 1091 will help reduce air pollution and create new jobs. My team at @GovArnoldUSC has been working with @joefitzgibbon for 3 years and I‚Äôm so proud of his leadership!
I want to congratulate all of the businesses and CEOs that have chosen to stand on the side of the voters and voting rights. You‚Äôre on the right side of history. Keep it up. https://t.co/K6qe6tL8cK
It was fantastic to meet you! I can‚Äôt wait to work together to fight pollution and save lives in the US and all over the world. https://t.co/omRkFItLTI

I had such a fantastic time directing this episode and hanging out with the Crypt Keeper. https://t.co/77J78Ccx8D
He was truly one of a kind and I hope each and every one of us can find inspiration in his story. I was lucky to know him and I will miss him dearly. My thoughts are with his family. 4/4
He told me the power of the body was nothing compared to the power of the mind. He was one of the strongest men in the world and he believed that real strength came from words. 3/
When I was lucky enough to really get to know him later, I was blown away. This man wasn‚Äôt just a great lifter - he was a great thinker. He talked about poetry and politics like a professor, and carried around more books than weights. 2/
Yuri Vlasov taught all of us that ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù is just a word. He was the first person to clean and jerk 200KG, and he inspired me when I met him as a young lifter in 1961. It is because of people like him that I refuse to call myself self-made. 1/ https://t.co/K4qGV0rzEz
https://t.co/GFhW6JHodX
When I ran for Governor, he was the first to support me. He became one of my most important supporters &amp; advisors. Instead of going on about how he filled every room he entered with joy &amp; wisdom, I‚Äôm sharing the letter I sent him on his 100th birthday. I will miss you, George. https://t.co/sFofOZlGXj
George had a servant‚Äôs heart that gave itself to this country until its very last beat. He was a great American, and a good man. He was a wonderful mentor to me and a visionary for our country. My thoughts are with Charlotte and his family.
We must always remember. Sadly, I see in social media comments every day how important it is that we never, ever forget. #HolocaustRemembranceDay https://t.co/sNdrqc3DB2

Chet Yorton was a legend. He beat me in the 1966 Mr. Universe when I was 19 and inspired me to be better, but he should be remembered for much more than that. He was a great father and he spread the message of health and fitness to millions. My thoughts are with his family.
I love meeting my heroes. Today I reached out to @C_C_Krebs to let him know he is one of my heroes. He is a great American who stood up for every voter in this country, and I am so grateful that he‚Äôs a public servant, not a party servant. https://t.co/APhUXN1LMg

Sean Connery was a legend, one of the greatest actors of all time. He provided endless entertainment for all of us &amp; inspiration for me. I‚Äôm not just saying that because he was a bodybuilder who placed in the Mr. Universe contest! He was an icon. My thoughts are with his family.

Gerrymandering protects politicians so they don‚Äôt have to listen to the people. The politicians in Missouri are proving that point by trying to overturn fair redistricting that voters passed just 2 years ago with 62% of the vote. Vote no on Amendment 3. https://t.co/WioGlNB9Oh

I always love a good opportunity to quote myself, but this time you beat me to it. You are right, pain is growth. It‚Äôs painful to grow and to learn, but if we don‚Äôt go through that pain, we‚Äôll never be better. Also, you need to work on your Austrian accent. @alexisohanian
‚ÄúThis is the chance for people in positions of power to lead. To use those positions to push us all further.‚Äù -@alexisohanian
My good friend @alexisohanian is up next to tell the inspiring story of why he gave up his board seat at the company he founded, my favorite website @reddit.
I knew I loved @WillHurd‚Äôs politics and foreign policy expertise, but I never knew he was such an expert on gaming!

@sonii @Twitch Thank you! Our moderators are doing a great job, but I didn‚Äôt want them to remove comments just for being political. I don‚Äôt mind trolls, but I would like everyone to listen and learn. Because like I said, I‚Äôd still be in Austria if I didn‚Äôt have an open mind.
‚ÄúDemocracy is only as strong as we the people demand it be.‚Äù -@ValerieJarrett

‚ÄúWe were upset by the fact that everybody is seeing this, and not everybody is having the same reaction.‚Äù -@BMarshh
And now we will be hearing from some amazing athletes. But not only are they amazing athletes, they are great intellectuals as well. Thank you for joining us @AngeMarieH @BMarshh @NateBoyer37 @nograyareas21! https://t.co/iWeusFctOW
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no coincidence that the areas with the most voter suppression, also have the most gerrymandering.‚Äù -@EricHolder
Now I‚Äôd like to welcome my good friend, bench press expert, and former Attorney General @EricHolder for another spirited discussion. I hope you all are enjoying this. https://t.co/iWeusFctOW
‚ÄúPolice brutality isn‚Äôt getting worse, cell phones are getting better.‚Äù -@esouthersHVE
‚ÄúCould you just open your mind a bit and say, ‚ÄúMaybe that wasn‚Äôt my experience with the police, but I can take the time to listen and learn about yours.‚Äù-@RepKarenBass
Next up we will be hearing from @RepKarenBass, @ChiefB_CvillePD, and @ChiefBisaFrench on Race and Public Safety. This will be a good one, tune in now!
‚ÄúWe want to show that racism isn‚Äôt just a few bad actors. Racism is also an interconnected system of policies and actions and other things that cyclically create a disadvantage for certain groups.‚Äù - @DrShaunHarper
Tune in now to Unfinished Business: Race and Equity in America, only on @Twitch! We will be hearing from some great thinkers and doers. See you there.

I had a fantastic time last night talking with @donlemon about my grants to open polling centers and our race and equity summit that starts in a few minutes on Twitch! Here‚Äôs the full interview: https://t.co/alJROvXxXT
Tune in to Unfinished Business to learn about race and equality today and all weekend. Please, do me a favor and turn off your political mind and learn. There are Republicans and Democrats speaking at the summit because equality is not a political issue. https://t.co/iWeusFctOW https://t.co/xb2zGsFKDC
This is what I call problem solving. I am so, so proud that Muscogee is using my grant not just to let more people vote, but to put people who have been furloughed since March back to work helping people vote! https://t.co/oem4SfSNyR
Please tune in Friday-Sunday. I‚Äôll be watching and learning with all of you, in between my sessions with @TheRevAl, @EricHolder, @ArtAcevedo, and @SecretaryCarson. Here is the link. See you tomorrow! https://t.co/iWeusFctOW
Of course I also have to thank my longtime buddy @TheRevAl for always being such a great friend and partnering with us to reach millions of people this weekend. You won‚Äôt want to miss our conversation Sunday.
I meant every word. And now it‚Äôs time for the work. I want to thank my friends @esouthersHVE and @DrShaunHarper for helping me dig into race issues to learn and for being my partners in this summit
‚ÄúWe have to be willing to listen, to learn, to look in the mirror &amp; see that none of us is perfect. We have to be willing to see one another as Americans, &amp; not as enemies. We have to be willing to sit down &amp; do the hard work of reform without worrying about stupid party lines.‚Äù

The grants are completely non-partisan and will be offered to those who demonstrate the greatest need and ability to close gaps in voting access. The process will be run through @GovArnoldUSC.
This country gave me everything, and I truly believe this could be one of the best investments I have ever made. All of us can do our part to give back and fight for equality.
Today I sent a letter to nearly 6,000 elections officials and county commissioners in states formerly covered by Voting Rights Act Section 5 inviting them to apply for grants, funded by me, to reopen polling centers and improve voting access.

This is a serious question. Is closing polling stations about making it harder for minorities to vote, or is it because of budgets? If you say it‚Äôs because of your budget, let‚Äôs talk.
I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot. I‚Äôm a fanatic about voting. Most people call closing polls voter suppression. Some say it is ‚Äúbudgetary.‚Äù What if I made it easy &amp; solved the budgetary issue? How much would it cost to reopen polling places? https://t.co/8mvy1OWBV2

Kelly Preston was extraordinary. I was lucky enough to star with her and direct her, and her talent was off the charts. She had such a big heart, she was a wonderful wife and mother, and my thoughts are with John and the whole family.
And he did so much. I have been lucky enough to meet a lot of my heroes, and I was so lucky to add Ephraim to that list, not once, but twice. I hope that his children grow up knowing what a great man their dad was. All of us can learn from his example.
When we met for the first time at the Special Olympics in South Africa 19 years ago, and when we met again last year to catch up, Ephraim talked about how much I inspired him. But if I had to say who left each meeting more inspired, it was definitely me.
I just heard the news that my friend Ephraim passed away. My thoughts are with his family, and I hope his wife and children can take comfort in knowing that Ephraim isn‚Äôt gone- his inspiration and energy lives on with all of us who knew him. https://t.co/lGuZSVLthk

Like I said to @BornFitness, more habits on autopilot without thinking = more time to focus on the things you really need to think about.

Since you guys love Whiskey and Lulu so much, 100% of the proceeds from this shirt will go to @ASASafterschool, to help in our mission to provide food for the families we serve while schools are closed. Support us here: https://t.co/BdutrbZKUF https://t.co/oqzjsT6kTK
Here‚Äôs your daily Lulu update - she‚Äôs not the best chess partner but she‚Äôs getting there. If you‚Äôve been putting off something like learning chess with your family, use the time you‚Äôd normally be out and about. https://t.co/S3QoBJtO7q
Here‚Äôs another great piece about our heroes: https://t.co/yXUN8Fzg13
Whiskey and Lulu need exercise too. https://t.co/PWVfHkv6B4
I promised to share good news about the heroes amongst us. Here‚Äôs another great piece about @sugarfish. https://t.co/QcHzhzdoWM
I‚Äôm going to take this as a compliment! Stay safe. https://t.co/N1bqhfTe4z
Thank you for doing such a great job social distancing. Remember to get outside for walks and bike rides to get your exercise but keep your distance from others and stay safe. We will get through this together. https://t.co/KoqPcXku0b
I‚Äôll keep sending Whiskey and Lulu updates, and you send me your favorite stories of doctors, nurses, truck drivers, grocery store stockers, people who check in on the elderly - anyone who gives you hope. I‚Äôll share in this thread throughout the crisis. Stay safe, stay at home.
I read this story in @TexasMonthly today about @HEB and it is a masterclass in preparation and being ready to support your community. https://t.co/boIJ9UfvqC
I know it can seem overwhelming and it can be easy to focus on the negative, so as I find them, I‚Äôm going to start sharing the stories of heroes who prepared, who stepped up to help their fellow Americans. They give me hope.
This crisis is unprecedented, but we have gotten through disasters, from earthquakes &amp; wildfires to hurricanes &amp; tornadoes by using the 7 P‚Äôs: Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance and by working together.
I never believed in sitting on the couch and complaining about how bad things are, I always believed we should all do our part to make things better. This is a simple way to protect our real action heroes on the frontlines in our hospitals, and I‚Äôm proud to be part of it. https://t.co/F7s1dh0YFz
@dog_rates Does Lulu qualify? https://t.co/2rmQ8fBnzm
Here‚Äôs your no-gym workout that only requires a broomstick and some chairs: https://t.co/CR8zQxJvvI https://t.co/kJV2sM1UUt
After my home workout, fueling up  with Whiskey and Lulu. https://t.co/keXGJye6MK
There are a lot of things we can‚Äôt control during this crisis, so we need to focus on what we can control. I wrote up my old no-gym required workout for all of you, as promised, because we can control our fitness. https://t.co/cL0gSMgf1o
A crisis requires improvisation. With schools closed, @ASASafterschool can‚Äôt provide our 100,000 kids with after-school programs, but we can still support them. Thanks to my friends @tiktok_us for this incredible $3M donation to feed our families. https://t.co/ips1FOM5lJ https://t.co/jL1gNQ2O5I
I know it‚Äôs not easy being home, but we all have to get along. Be like Lulu, not Cherry. Use this time to spread kindness, check in on your family and friends, and of course, no biting. https://t.co/7DfhmYz3lo
Stay. At. Home. That means you, too, spring breakers. https://t.co/jUOgjLaOGN
Doctors say that riding my bike outside is OK so it‚Äôs the only way I‚Äôm leaving the house, but if you do ride your bike or go for a walk, don‚Äôt stop, avoid social contact. Apologies to everyone but I won‚Äôt be stopping on my rides for selfies. Stay positive, stay safe. https://t.co/WAb4h57VAZ

I was proud to join my friends @JohnKasich and @JohnKerry for our first @WorldWarZeroOrg townhall in Columbus. The only way we can terminate pollution is Republicans and Democrats working together. There isn‚Äôt Republican air or Democratic air. It‚Äôs time to unite &amp; protect health. https://t.co/rqBu3nuY7e

I‚Äôm really sorry that our fans can‚Äôt watch our sports. But the state said that parents can watch their kids. We have decided that any parent or guardian shouldn‚Äôt have to pay. No tickets required. https://t.co/JU9g3Vc1Gt
The state has ordered that only the Friday and Saturday night bodybuilding and strongman shows can have attendees. The general public can‚Äôt watch sports. Parents of minors can. I will see everyone at 7pm Friday and Saturday.
Since there are questions: all sports will continue, and I am looking forward to seeing the athletes compete. I‚Äôll be keeping everyone updated on proper precautions throughout the weekend.
It‚Äôs a sad day for me and everyone at the @ArnoldSports team. But we will always put our fans‚Äô health first. After discussions with @GovMikeDeWine, @MayorGinther, and the CDC, we will be postponing the expo because we can‚Äôt risk bringing 250,000 people together with #COVID19. https://t.co/Fuzcmapxiy
I can't wait to be back in Columbus, Ohio next week for the Arnold Sports Festival with 250,000 of my closest friends. 85 different sports, 22,000 athletes, 80 nations. Our fitness crusade gets bigger and bigger every year. https://t.co/wEKN508wAd
This time I brought LuLu too. https://t.co/4KLxA9eLV1
@SamWangPhD I like your style Professor!
@VVforDelegate Thank you for working to terminate gerrymandering! This has been a passion of mine since my first attempt in 2005 in CA so I love when I see other good government reformers trying to make government work for the people.
@breaddrink1 I have fought against gerrymandering in Democratic states and Republican states. The issue is not partisan for me. But to answer your question, the Democratic Party controls the VA legislature and Governor's office.
All eyes are on Virginia, and I urge the General Assembly to support the amendment. I want to thank my friends from @1VA2021 for tirelessly fighting day after day to #terminategerrymandering.
This amendment is the only way to truly prevent the legislature from rigging district lines in the future, and time is running out for lawmakers to act.
Gerrymandering has always been a bipartisan problem, and it requires a bipartisan solution. I hope the General Assembly will support the amendment as they did in 2019.
Virginia is at a crossroads, and the General Assembly is left with 2 options: a constitutional amendment with broad support, or an advisory commission that will not prevent the legislature from drawing their own district lines. This is an easy choice. https://t.co/KqohoeHuNm
It was fantastic to meet with @DennisCulhane from @AISP_Penn, who is one of the best minds in the nation when it comes to our homelessness crisis. As I learn more about this issue, I‚Äôm more hopeful than ever that we can solve it if everyone will work together. https://t.co/LBktQQeKLM
Let me tell you a personal story about our homelessness crisis. We can fix this - if we put politics and selfishness aside and work together. https://t.co/BKgkdeL63A
@realDonaldTrump We‚Äôll all have to come together at the federal, state and local level, regardless of politics, to solve this issue. https://t.co/vd65KbbnyS
Thank you for joining us and putting the spotlight on this issue! https://t.co/ffY1cFgy0U
Everyone knows @realDonaldTrump &amp; I have our disagreements. But I want to thank you for sending @SecretaryCarson to our homelessness summit. We‚Äôll only solve this if everyone works together. This issue is bigger than all of us. Now it‚Äôs time for action https://t.co/gJVNs3h10f
Thank you to @kdeleon, Assemblyman @SantiagoAD53, and my old buddy @HerbJWesson for brainstorming long-term solutions. It‚Äôs time to stop the no-growth ways of the past and let the market work.
Thank you to Supervisor @mridleythomas for joining Steiny to share your work on the Governor‚Äôs homelessness task force with all of us.
Thank you to Senator @HollyJMitchell, Supervisor @kathrynbarger, and Mayor @RobertGarciaLB for discussing short-term solutions to help bridge the gap for the Californians left behind.
Thank you Mayor @ericgarcetti for your passion and your problem-solving. It was fantastic to hear from you and I look forward to working together with you more on this issue.
Thank you Mayor @Kevin_Faulconer for sharing what has worked in San Diego and giving the audience hope that we can lick this problem.
Thank you to @Mayor_Steinberg, my old friend, for speaking on two panels and explaining your policy proposals. You‚Äôve always been a genius, and I always love working with you.
Thank you to Professor @GaryDeanPainter for laying out the issues and explaining how many people are economically homeless and how we can fix our housing market.
Thank you @GovernorDavis for joining us today. This isn‚Äôt a Republican or Democratic issue and we all have to work together to solve it. You‚Äôre a great friend and a champion.
Today‚Äôs @GovArnoldUSC/@USCPriceCSI homelessness summit was eye-opening and educational. No success is self-made, so I want to thank all of the experts and leaders who made it a success. https://t.co/gJVNs3h10f

These firefighters represented the best of America. They answered the call to travel all the way around the world because their bravery and experience could save lives. They are heroes, and my thoughts are with their families, friends, and their fellow firefighters. https://t.co/J8AKGCctqM

"Rituals &gt; Resolutions. Resolutions are a fantastic way to build a vision, but habits &amp; routines - rituals - are what get you to your success. Automate &amp; do the reps and you will win.

@theodd1sout Thank you for supporting @CALFIREFound, the Ventura County Fire Department Widows, Orphans &amp; Assistance fund, and the Santa Monica Firefighters Relief Fund! I can‚Äôt wait to see you there.

Between succeeding with you books, your marriage, and your animals, I don‚Äôt know where you find the time but you are a champion! I love you.
Happy birthday @KSchwarzenegger my chin-up princess! You have been pulling yourself your whole life! You have had such an incredible year and I am so proud of you. https://t.co/vqI8HTPcTw
Today was a fantastic celebration. But it is a wonderful reminder that we can do great things if we work together, don‚Äôt worry about ego or party, and think big. https://t.co/MmoFFOJvQ6
This is Troy. I met him today. He grew up in Bakersfield where he said the two job choices were agriculture or oil. He chose oil and worked his ass off drilling. But today he works in the solar industry, and he loves his job. I want everyone to hear his story. https://t.co/qsDeJCYWuV
3. If politicians are willing to pass big, visionary laws that they won‚Äôt be able to celebrate in time for their next campaign, we can do great things. Building a million solar roofs took 13 years. We are all out of office and can‚Äôt use it to win re-election. But the people win.
2. Consistency creates investment. CA has been on this path for decades, since Governor Reagan. We don‚Äôt give the voters whiplash by changing our environmental policies every administration. @JerryBrownGov continued the program after I was out of office. We stay on the path.
"Three quick lessons:
1. No success is self-made. Without Senator Kevin Murray, who wrote the bill, without the activists, without my great staff, and without the hardworking Californians who work in our booming solar industry, we wouldn‚Äôt be here."
Proud to celebrate California‚Äôs million solar roofs today. This is an example of government working. We promised that 3 billion dollars would create 1 million roofs and 3,000 megawatts. And we got 1 million roofs and almost 9,000 megawatts. We under-promised &amp; over-delivered. https://t.co/UvTNjbK5lP
In 2006, we set a goal to build a million solar roofs in California by 2019. With the help of a lot of hardworking Californians, we did it. Watch our celebration live: https://t.co/O1MNd8p6eE

We must continue to honor the victims, we must hold up and thank the police, paramedics and firefighters for their heroism, and we must never forget. Never.
I left that day with a stomach so full I was about to pop. But I also left with a full heart, because I saw the best of America.
And let me tell you: firefighters can cook. I ate one meal after another because I didn‚Äôt want to be rude, and when you have a chance to eat with your heroes, you never say no.
At Ground Zero, I saw them working through tears and hugged more heroes than I could count. At the three firehouses I visited, they just wanted me to work out and eat with them.
They were exhausted and they were in mourning, but they just kept going because they were serving a cause bigger than themselves.
I will always remember visiting the first responders in New York less than a month later. I was there to help pump them up after their tragic, non-stop work. But they were the ones who inspired me.
Today we remember. We remember the victims, their families, and the heroes. We remember the way the country came together and stood as one.

Happy birthday to my dear friend, the great visionary @JimCameron. As you know, @Terminator changed my life. You are a big reason that I can never call myself self-made. This early storyboard you drew for Terminator reminds me of your big vision, and I cherish it. https://t.co/nexZJIGIuy

It‚Äôs #WorldElephantDay, so here‚Äôs a throwback to when my team and I were chased by a beautiful elephant on a safari in South Africa. We need to do all we can to preserve these animals.

@ericmwalker @darth Verrrry nice!
This is why I am proud to stand with reform-minded leaders like @GovLarryHogan to give the people their power back. https://t.co/EVsSC34QSU
In the meantime, my institute, @GovArnoldUSC, is finishing up a study so that you can truly see how gerrymandering creates dangerous levels of misrepresentation, and I can't wait to share it with you.
The solution is taking the power to draw their lines away from the politicians and giving it to independent commissions, as states around the country are doing. I will continue to fight for reform across the country, in Republican and Democratic states.
"To my fellow Republicans who say this doesn't matter, remember that the tables can turn. For years, Democrats were the leaders in gerrymandering efforts, and President Reagan called gerrymandering ""anti-Democratic and un-American."""
One person/one vote is a vital part of our government, but gerrymandering allows politicians to pick their voters and scam the system and the people don't get the representation they deserve.
In West Virginia, Democrats received 41% of the votes for the U.S House, but 0% of the seats.
In Arkansas, Democrats received 36% of the votes for the U.S House, but 0% of the seats.
In Pennsylvania, Democrats won 54.1% of the State House election vote, but 45.8% of the seats.
In Virginia, Democrats received 54% of the State House election vote, but 48% of the seats.
In Illinois, Democrats won 61% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 72% of the seats.
Also in Wisconsin, Democrats won 54% of the votes for State Assembly, but 36% of the seats.
In Wisconsin, Republicans won 46% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 63% of the seats.
In Texas, Republicans won 50% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 64% of the seats.
In North Carolina, Republicans won 51% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 77% of the seats.
In Maryland, Republicans won 32.5% of the votes for U.S. House, but only 12.5% of the seats.
Gerrymandering deprives Americans of all parties of their representation. Instead, we get mis-representation. I‚Äôm going to share some examples in this thread so you know exactly why I fight for reform and #FairMaps. https://t.co/EVsSC34QSU
@Midgard8_3 By creating independent commissions that draw the districts instead of letting the politicians draw their own districts.
Instead of being distracted by television ratings, let‚Äôs fix our politics. The only way to drain the swamp is by letting the voters pick their politicians, instead of continuing to let the politicians pick their voters. #terminategerrymandering https://t.co/EVsSC34QSU
Check out my op-ed with @GovLarryHogan and help us terminate gerrymandering once and for all. https://t.co/EVsSC34QSU https://t.co/BO0WicUWB4
We aren‚Äôt happy with the Supreme Court‚Äôs misguided decision, but @GovLarryHogan and I know we can still terminate gerrymandering. It‚Äôs time to get to work. https://t.co/EVsSC34QSU

We will continue to fight in the legislatures, we will continue to fight at the ballot boxes, and we will continue to fight in state courts. And we will win.
I want to remind everyone who feels pessimistic right now that last year, when we were disappointed in the Court‚Äôs decision, we got back to work and voters went to the polls in 5 states to reject partisan gerrymandering.
While I‚Äôm disappointed with the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision, this isn‚Äôt the end of our fight to terminate gerrymandering.
I like it. https://t.co/bCdTSDZDwJ

We just raised a record $5 million for @ASASafterschool after-school program at our annual western fundraiser at my house. Thanks to every donor. Your $ matters. This is Ti‚ÄôAndre.

@EricHolder Same to you, my friend. Let's #terminategerrymandering all over the country.
I was inspired when I heard about these young afterschool advocates visiting Capitol Hill to tell their elected officials that #AfterschoolWorks yesterday. Please reach out to your members of Congress and show your support! https://t.co/ry6sCmbQ33 https://t.co/VLNLsZDHs7
Gerrymandering robs the people of their right to fair representation. I was proud to fight to establish an independent commission in CA to return power to the people over a decade ago &amp; I‚Äôm proud to stand with @EricHolder for bipartisan reform in NH today. https://t.co/wePISse5Nq

Update: A lot of you have asked, but I‚Äôm not pressing charges. I hope this was a wake-up call, and he gets his life on the right track. But I‚Äôm moving on and I‚Äôd rather focus on the thousands of great athletes I met at @ArnoldSports Africa.
And now I will get to see Ephraim next year. I‚Äôve asked him to be an ambassador for @SO_SouthAfrica to connect their events with our @ArnoldSports festival. And I can‚Äôt wait!
I also want to thank @humansofny for using the internet for good, for bringing people together, and not to tear people apart. This time you brought me together with someone I met 18 years ago, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.
I wanted to hear for myself, straight from him, how fantastic he is doing. And wow, what an inspiration. Coaching sports at a school, raising a family, and serving on the board of @SO_SouthAfrica. Just incredible and heartwarming.
I want to thank @humansofny for helping me reconnect with Ephraim while I‚Äôm in Johannesburg for the @ArnoldSports Africa. We got to catch up today and it was fantastic. https://t.co/kIc2LMoGC7

Thanks for your concerns, but there is nothing to worry about. I thought I was just jostled by the crowd, which happens a lot. I only realized I was kicked when I saw the video like all of you. I‚Äôm just glad the idiot didn‚Äôt interrupt my Snapchat.
