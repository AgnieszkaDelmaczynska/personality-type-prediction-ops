Funny. @SenToomey never called for spending caps on the war‚Ä¶only on the health care for veterans sickened by said wars. Interesting priorities. #PassthePactact
Morning @SenToomey I'd rather be a pseudo celeb than pseudo Senator! Take your amendment vote at the same 60 threshold Veterans had to hit...Good luck capping and rationing care!!!!!
"The PACT Act is a stand alone bill. The PACT Act has no spending unrelated to Veteran's Health and Benefits. There is no ""Pork"". There is no budget maneuver that then allows Dems to backfill w whatever they want...but as a registered Liberal Piece of Shit...don't take my word. https://t.co/WuIi8zGnwg"

This isn‚Äôt a game. Real people‚Äôs lives hang in the balance‚Ä¶people that fought for your life. The PACT act you voted for, then inexplicably shot down is the same one Senators Tester and Moran posted online in MAY. Which you read cuz yer shmart.
No one is playing politics with the Pact Act but you, Toomey and your band of merry monsters. Stop fucking around and pass the bill you already had passed. Thank you for coming to my TedCruz talk.
Show everyone what was added/snuck into the Pact Act that YOU voted for on June 16, that made you change to No in July. Be specific. Or were you for the bill before you were against it Senator Kerry‚Ä¶I mean Cruz. Next
Show everyone where in the Pact Act is this 400 billion dollars blank check or unrelated spending that was added/snuck in‚Ä¶OR show section 805 c of the actual bill that explicitly states what the Toxic Exposure Fund can be used for. Next

Hey!! @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle @TuckerCarlson @JesseBWatters AMERICAN VETERANS are sick and dying and need your help. You‚Äôre the only ones the R Senators will listen to. Help them! #PACTAct #supporttroopsnotwarmachine
The question is..How do you shame the shameless? @SenToomey @LeaderMcConnell #supportveterans  #notthewarmachine or really..how do you shame the shameful?
"Hello Media?
1030 AM. Senate Swamp. @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC @ABCNewsPR @CBSNews @NBCNews  Come hear the hurt, anger, frustration and disbelief from the veteran community. They‚Äôve been betrayed."
Not one of these stab vets in the back Senators should get to leave for the Summer til this shit is fixed. Not one.
I call bullshit. https://t.co/uCKQohP92B
PS Fuck the R caucus and their empty promise to our veterans.
For the veterans,and their families and caregivers who will bear the brunt of this nonsense‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt over‚Ä¶we will never stop the fight until this country honors its promise to you.
6 trillion for war- No guidelines or oversight‚Ä¶but for Veterans Healthcare?? Let‚Äôs play budget gimmick games. We live in the upside down.
Congratulations @SenToomey You successfully used the Byzantine Senate rules to keep sick veterans suffering!!!! Kudos! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll celebrate by kicking a dog or punching a baby‚Ä¶or whatever terrible people do for fun!!!!!
Today in the Senate R caucus lunch @SenToomey will attempt to further delay urgent health care for veterans, perhaps while enjoying a nice piece of fish and a glass of Pinot...or maybe he will fuck them over while having cobbler...#mustbenice
Please call every R Senate office you can and let them know vets have waited long enough for the Health Care and Benefits they earned...@SenToomey has already cost them lives and piece of mind...#Whenwillthisfuckeryend
Today the Senate takes another vote on #PACTact and once again @SenToomey is working hard behind the scenes to kill the bill...of course he won't meet w Veteran groups in person...He won't speak answer to media or constituents... Coward?

Morning folks!! Your daily reminder that @SenToomey is still preventing veterans from accessing the health care and benefits they've earned!! Check out Pat's Twitter page...It's him...w the military??? I hope he's telling them how he is fucking them.
Thoughts? @SenToomey @DrOz @JohnFetterman
A word like, Senator Pat Toomey is singlehandedly holding up health care for millions of veterans? Using vets as pawns? Just so Rs can burn more floor time? Too many words?? https://t.co/Hmkerh0vW6

AAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Or is this just a cynical ploy to burn more Senate floor time and use veterans as a political toy??? And could @CNN @Fox or @MSNBC please hold them to account on this? Hell I'd take @OANN at this point!!!!!
"the ""concerns"" @SenToomey expresses seem reasonable...Except they have all already been asked and answered in the 3 year development of the bill. All major VSOs support. It passed the Senate 84 to 14...so...what say you @DrOz and @LeaderMcConnell"
Hello @DrOz  do you agree with @SenToomey decision to block a simple technical fix to the #PACTact and delay lifesaving health care for veterans? The bill passed w huge support...the fix is ONE SENTENCE!! @SenToomey won't allow Unanimous Consent.
"But while I have your attention, could all of you (including news orgs) please ask @PatToomey why he is single-handedly stalling a veterans health care bill that passed w huge bipartisan support over a technicality? Asking for 3.5 million friends.
