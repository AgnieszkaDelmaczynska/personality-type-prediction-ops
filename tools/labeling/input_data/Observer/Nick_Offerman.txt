Raw linseed oil never dries - you want polymerized Linseed oil or Danish oil or Tung oil…"

Sandwich the walnut between 2 scrap boards and clamp solidly. Meticulously transfer your hole’s center point to the top of the sandwich, then drill through the scrap and the walnut as one. Clamp soundly and take your time."
