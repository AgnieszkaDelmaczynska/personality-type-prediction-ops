But in the 10 years since, the families of Sandy Hook have taken unimaginable sorrow and channeled it into a righteous cause—setting an example of strength and resolve. Take a moment to learn more about them and how you can help at https://t.co/pQ4FRPyRSH.
I consider December 14th, 2012 the single darkest day of my presidency. The news from Sandy Hook Elementary was devastating, a visceral blow, and like so many others, I felt not just sorrow but anger at a world that could allow such things to happen. https://t.co/Y2log7FBaH
"It’s a landmark moment in the fight for equality, and a tribute to the generations of Americans whose example and advocacy have done more than any law to change hearts and minds.

This is their victory, and a powerful reminder that, together, we can continue to perfect our union."
By mandating the federal recognition of same-sex marriages, the Respect for Marriage Act brings us closer to preserving the fundamental right of every American to marry who they love.
"In 2015, when the Supreme Court recognized the Constitutional right to marriage equality, I said that progress often comes in small increments. Then there are days when slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.

Today is one of those days."
Grateful for the long-overdue release of Brittney Griner today from Russian custody. Kudos to @POTUS and his administration for the difficult diplomatic work involved to make it happen. We’re looking forward to having Brittney back home. https://t.co/G5yKliRoxd

"One of my favorite White House traditions was telling Thanksgiving jokes – which at least I thought were funny. 

Here’s a look back at some of my favorites: https://t.co/t2azgScNau"
Wishing everyone a happy Thanksgiving! As we celebrate, let's give thanks for all the blessings in our lives and give back when we can. We’re also thinking of the brave men and women serving our country far from their home.
"But voters in some states—including Florida, Texas, and Wisconsin—are still affected by gerrymandering.

That’s why we’ve got to stay in the fight and keep working to stop partisan gerrymandering once and for all. Join us: https://t.co/UVae8RTjja"
Thanks in part to the NDRC, states that were once gerrymandered by Republicans—Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Colorado, Minnesota—are now highly competitive. And that’s how it should be—voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.
One reason the balance of power in the House of Representatives is so close is because, for the first time in a decade, there were enough competitive districts at play. Thanks to the work of @DemRedistrict, Americans voted on the fairest congressional map of the last 40 years.
We can and must do more to reduce gun violence in America. https://t.co/cfI3RIMLd2

But the fight to protect DACA recipients remains unfinished. Earlier this year I sat down with a group of Dreamers, whose stories speak to all the ways in which they strengthen our communities. Congress should act now and resolve their status once and for all.

Congratulations to all the organizers and volunteers in South Dakota on the results last week – and to all those whose work to expand Medicaid has made it possible for millions of Americans to access health care.
It’s why we pushed so hard for the ACA – because health care should be a right, not a privilege. But just as important, it’s a testament to what can happen when citizens are willing to grab some clipboards, get some signatures, and build a coalition to bring about change.
"Last week, voters in South Dakota chose to expand access to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, making it possible for more than 40,000 South Dakotans to access health care.

With this good news, 39 states have now expanded Medicaid since 2012.

Getting the right folks in these jobs – and many others – was an important step. But we can’t rest. We need to keep speaking out against dangerous candidates, keep supporting good ones, and keep voting up and down the ballot. Our democracy depends on it.
.@Adrian_Fontes was just elected Secretary of State in Arizona. Adrian’s opponent was at the Capitol on January 6th, and suggested he might reject Democratic votes in the future. Adrian believes every vote should count, and now he’ll be able to make it happen in Arizona.
.@JocelynBenson has been doing a great job as Michigan’s Secretary of State. She was just re-elected, and will continue to make sure every Michiganders vote counts in every election.
Let's celebrate Democratic candidates like @CiscoForNevada, who will be Nevada’s next Secretary of State. His opponent spread conspiracy theories and lies about voting machines. Cisco will protect the integrity of Nevada’s elections.
I can't emphasize enough how much Secretary of State races matter. They don’t always get the most attention, but they’re crucial to ensuring we have fair elections—and this time, voters across the country chose candidates who will fight for democracy.
Thanks to all those who have proudly served our country in uniform, and the families who have served alongside them. We owe you so much—on Veterans Day, and every day.
"For democracy to thrive, we need to tell better stories about ourselves, and how we can live together despite our differences.

"But our work isn’t finished. Now we need folks to actually vote – not just to build on the progress we’ve made, but to protect our democracy.

Make a plan to vote and visit https://t.co/Yk3gzyCA4v to learn how you can get involved."
Over the last few years, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee has organized volunteers and activists to keep Republicans from redrawing electoral maps in their favor. And it worked. This fall, voters will have the fairest maps in a generation.
"Thanks to @EricHolder and @DemRedistrict, more voters will be able to choose their politicians in this next election instead of the other way around.

And what better way to celebrate that progress than to hear from @JohnLegend, @iamwill, and @JayPharoah. https://t.co/8x27UCf0Ud"
Congratulations to Hawai'i for cruising to their fourth Little League World Series title! I'm so proud of this team. 🤙🏾 https://t.co/l37BTGjW5G
This is life changing news for millions of borrowers working to pay back their student loans. It's also a testament to @POTUS, his administration, and all the activists who've been calling for student debt relief for years. https://t.co/n4wBnHNP1E
I will always be grateful that we had a once-in-a-century public health leader to guide us through a once-in-a-century pandemic. Few people have touched more lives than Dr. Fauci – and I’m glad he’s not done yet.

There’s a lot to digest in the Inflation Reduction Act, but don’t miss this part: starting in 2025, people on Medicare will save hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year on their prescriptions. https://t.co/coXaVpFbiB
Here’s the truth: @danpfeiffer’s latest book, Battling the Big Lie, is an important read for anyone who’s wondering how the far right traffics in lies and what we can all do to fight back. As we head into election season, it could not be more timely. https://t.co/6ZPRbSIiBt
Thanks to President Biden and Democrats in Congress, people’s bills will get smaller, their lives will get longer, and we’ll have a real shot at avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. That’s something Democrats everywhere can and should be proud of.
The Inflation Reduction Act that just passed the Senate is a major accomplishment. Not only will it reduce inflation and lower the cost of prescription drugs – it also happens to be the most consequential piece of climate legislation in American history. https://t.co/w3s3E8rGoZ
Thanks to the members of our Obama Alumni family whose generosity helped bring this incredible project to life. I can’t wait for you to see it.
The Ann Dunham Water Garden will be a special place for visitors and members of the community to reflect. It will also feature an incredible new sculpture by Maya Lin, whose work I've long admired.
"My mother, Ann Dunham, was the biggest influence on my life, and helped shape me into the person I am today.

I’m proud to share that the Water Garden at the Obama Presidential Center will be named in her honor. https://t.co/p7oAnH66eo"
You bet, Joe. 31 million folks enrolled and the lowest uninsured rate ever. Now Congress needs to pass the Inflation Reduction Act to build on this progress. https://t.co/P23rP0K6J2
Tonight’s news is also proof that it’s possible to root out terrorism without being at war in Afghanistan. And I hope it provides a small measure of peace to the 9/11 families and everyone else who has suffered at the hands of al-Qaeda.
It’s a tribute to President Biden’s leadership, to the members of the intelligence community who have been working for decades for this moment, and to the counterterrorism professionals who were able to take al-Zawahiri out without a single civilian casualty.
More than 20 years after 9/11, one of the masterminds of that terrorist attack and Osama bin Laden’s successor as the leader of al-Qaeda – Ayman al-Zawahiri – has finally been brought to justice.
"For decades, Bill endured insults and vandalism, but never let it stop him from speaking up for what’s right. I learned so much from the way he played, the way he coached, and the way he lived his life.

Michelle and I send our love to Bill’s family, and everyone who admired him."
Perhaps more than anyone else, Bill knew what it took to win and what it took to lead. On the court, he was the greatest champion in basketball history. Off of it, he was a civil rights trailblazer—marching with Dr. King and standing with Muhammad Ali.
"Today, we lost a giant.

As tall as Bill Russell stood, his legacy rises far higher—both as a player and as a person."
I’m grateful to President Biden and those in Congress – Democrat or Republican – who are working to deliver for the American people. Progress doesn’t always happen all at once, but it does happen – and this is what it looks like.
Then President Biden and Democrats in Congress announced a deal that will fight inflation by reducing the cost of prescription drugs, cutting the deficit, and making the biggest investments in history to boost clean energy and tackle the climate crisis.
This has been a big week for the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress. First, Congress is on track to pass a bipartisan bill that will lower the cost of everything from cars to consumer goods, and make us less dependent on foreign semiconductors.

Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment.
I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance, the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle.
I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and longtime partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. Former Prime Minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan.

As we celebrate today, let's thank our armed forces and their families for their service to our country.

The Stonewall Uprising helped galvanize a movement for LGBTQ+ rights. The progress we’ve made in the years since is a testament to what happens when people organize and demand change. But we need to do more to safeguard LGBTQ+ rights and expand on those hard-earned victories.
In 2016, I was proud to designate the Stonewall National Monument as the first national monument to tell the story of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights. https://t.co/sTddgnS6DS
Climate change is no longer just about the future that we're trying to protect for our children or our grandchildren; it's about the reality we're living with now. That’s why it’s more urgent now than ever before that Congress pass @POTUS’ climate and clean energy investments.
The 6-3 decision strikes a blow to the EPA’s authority to regulate power plant emissions—paving the way to dismantle some of the most impactful provisions of the Clean Air Act and limit our ability to reduce carbon pollution.
No challenge poses a greater threat to our future than a changing climate. Every day, we’re feeling the impact of climate change, and today’s Supreme Court decision is a major step backward.
As president, I saw Chancellor Merkel lead through crises with her wise pragmatism, good humor, and unrelenting moral compass—and I feel lucky to call her a friend. Grateful for the chance to visit the @NMAAHC today, a reminder that America is a constant work in progress. https://t.co/CggYWllm31

Today, the Supreme Court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent, it relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues—attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.
"Progress isn’t always a straight line.
 
Today’s Supreme Court decision is wrong but Congress passing the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a modest but real step forward. And the fight will go on, thanks to the activists, survivors, and families who continue to demand action."

We remember that even in the darkest hours, there is cause to hope for tomorrow’s light. Let us all recommit ourselves today to honoring those who fought over generations to steer our country closer to our highest ideals.
Juneteenth is a time to commemorate the anniversary of the delayed news of freedom reaching the enslaved Black folks in Galveston, Texas. Today, we remember that struggle for freedom as we reflect on how far we’ve come as a country—and on the work that remains undone.
With four championships in eight years, the @Warriors leave no doubt of their place as one of the NBA’s greatest dynasties. Congrats to Finals MVP Steph, Draymond, Klay, Coach Kerr and the rest of Dub Nation for such sustained excellence.

Read more in my speech about how we can renew democracy by promoting more inclusive markets, political participation, community building, and less polarizing technology platforms. https://t.co/9E5FoQIBKn
And we will also have to be willing to look squarely at the shortcomings of our own democracies—not the ideal, but the reality. Only then will we be able to tell a better story of what democracy can be, and must be, in this rapidly changing world.
The point is, if we want democracy to flourish, we will have to fight for it. We will have to nurture it. We will have to demonstrate its value, again and again, in improving the lives of ordinary people.
In my own country, the forces that unleashed mob violence on our Capitol are still churning out misinformation and conspiracy theories. For those of us who fervently believe in the ideals of democracy, the question is: How do we respond?
Just as disturbing, within democracies, populist appeals grounded in fear, bigotry, and resentment have elevated leaders who, once they’re in office, have sought to systematically undermine democratic institutions and entrench themselves in power.
On every continent, emboldened autocrats are ramping up oppression, they’re targeting minority groups, they’re often flouting international law.
Yesterday, I spoke at the Copenhagen Democracy Summit to discuss the challenges to democracy around the world, and the work we can do right now with the next generation of leaders to chart a better course. https://t.co/4BrkCD2bFn

In the aftermath of his murder, a new generation of activists rose up to channel their anguish into organized action, launching a movement to raise awareness of systemic racism and the need for criminal justice and police reform.
As we grieve the children of Uvalde today, we should take time to recognize that two years have passed since the murder of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer. His killing stays with us all to this day, especially those who loved him.
May God bless the memory of the victims, and in the words of Scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds.
It’s long past time for action, any kind of action. And it’s another tragedy—a quieter but no less tragic one—for families to wait another day.
Michelle and I grieve with the families in Uvalde, who are experiencing pain no one should have to bear.
Across the country, parents are putting their children to bed, reading stories, singing lullabies—and in the back of their minds, they’re worried about what might happen tomorrow after they drop their kids off at school, or take them to a grocery store or any other public space.

https://t.co/gNCvJlLnWK"
When it comes to climate change, time really is running out. Earth Day is a reminder that if we pledge to do our part and then follow through on those commitments, we can help preserve and protect our planet for future generations.
It’s up to each of us to decide what we value, and to use the tools we’ve been given to advance those values. I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift – a government of, by, and for the people – for generations to come.
Solving the disinformation problem won’t cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world. But it can help rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make democracy stronger.
Each of us has to pick a side. Do we allow our democracy to wither? Or do we choose to make it better? That’s the choice we face, and it is a choice worth embracing.
"As part of this, tech platforms need to recognize that they play a unique role in how people consume information, and their decisions have an impact on every aspect of society.

Tomorrow, I'm heading to Stanford to deliver a speech about changes in the way we create and consume information, and the very real threat it poses to democracy.
Through the @ObamaFoundation, we’re working to empower and equip emerging leaders to tackle issues like the spread of disinformation. https://t.co/e5T9rq4JUN
Part of the reason it’s hard to bring about change is because we live in a media environment that elevates falsehoods as much as truths, and divides people as much as it brings them together.
In recent years, we've seen how quickly disinformation spreads, especially on social media. This has created real challenges for our democracy.

But the ACA was never perfect, and we always knew we would have to make it better. That’s what @POTUS has done since taking office. Today, he’s going even further – lowering premiums for nearly 1 million people and helping 200,000 more uninsured Americans get access to coverage.
The ACA also lowered prescription drug costs for 12 million seniors, and allowed young people to stay on their parents’ plan. And it’s eliminated lifetime limits on benefits that often put people in a jam.
Because so many people made sacrifices and some members of Congress took courageous votes, we got the ACA across the finish line. Now, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage, and 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can’t be dropped or denied coverage.
Passing the ACA was incredibly difficult. People who had coverage were worried about losing it, the media was skeptical, misinformation was flying around, and Republicans showed no interest in working with us. But Joe, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and I were determined.
"The Affordable Care Act is an example of why you run for office – not just to occupy a seat, but to make a difference in people’s lives.

Today I’m joining @POTUS and @VP at the White House to celebrate everything the ACA has achieved, and help make it even better."
Congratulations to the @KUHoops team on winning the national championship. This team was fun to watch, and they earned their first title since 2008 (which was a pretty good year).
Congratulations to the @GamecockWBB team and coach @DawnStaley for winning the national championship. Coach Staley has built a powerhouse, and it’s great to see all their hard work pay off. https://t.co/fZOOMKRmtC

".@POTUS’s American Rescue Plan helped strengthen the Affordable Care Act by lowering costs and encouraging a record 14.5 million people to sign up for coverage in 2022. 

We'll keep working to improve the ACA until every American has access to quality, affordable health coverage."
During the pandemic, the Affordable Care Act helped make vaccines and COVID-19 tests available for free, covered emergency hospitalizations, and prevented insurance companies from denying anyone coverage based on a pre-existing condition.
"12 years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. I’ve always believed that health care shouldn’t be a privilege for just a fortunate few, but a right for every American. 

Today, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/DmjgC00LpP"

The @ObamaFoundation has compiled more stories of people who are going above and beyond to help those in need. I hope you’ll read some of them and find ways to get involved: https://t.co/TYAmrwCIUf
.@Airbnb is offering free, short-term housing for 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine. https://t.co/iBLlGM8Pgj

It’s hard to believe it's been 10 years since Trayvon Martin was killed. Leading up to this anniversary, I reflected on what his death meant to me as president, as a Black parent, and as a Black man—as well as what it meant for our country. https://t.co/Ywt22dOGup
As a protégé of Justice Breyer, Judge Jackson earned a reputation for pragmatism and consensus building. It’s part of why I nominated her twice – first as a district judge, and then to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, where she earned praise from both Democrats and Republicans.
I want to congratulate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on her nomination to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson has already inspired young Black women like my daughters to set their sights higher, and her confirmation will help them believe they can be anything they want to be. https://t.co/aCwiUBFTyj

I want to thank everyone who has joined @AllOnTheLine in its mission to end gerrymandering. Every phone call, every testimony, every action has made a difference in the redistricting process. And while our fight for #FairMaps isn’t over, we’ve made real progress.
And in Ohio, @AllOnTheLine held 139 training sessions—equipping thousands of Ohioans from every corner of the state with the information and tools they need to fight for fair maps. And when the pandemic hit, All On The Line took its training online. https://t.co/DVWvLslKU4
In North Carolina, Karla Icaza De Austin, an Army veteran from Fayetteville, urged her state legislators to demand transparency, accountability, and fairness in the redistricting process—and reminded them of their duty to follow the will of the people. https://t.co/DhUwYbVTjl
Since then, folks across the country have participated in the redistricting process—many for the first time. It’s a testament to the work @AllOnTheLine has done to help folks understand why fair maps matter, and make an impact in their communities.
Three years ago, I helped @EricHolder launch @AllOnTheLine, a people-powered campaign to fight gerrymandering and advocate for fair redistricting. All On The Line is driven by the core belief that voters should choose their representatives—not the other way around.
John Lewis knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time. His life was a lesson in the fierce urgency of now. On his birthday, let’s honor his legacy by taking action and creating the change we hope to see in our own communities.
It’s exactly the kind of ambition we need if we’re going to protect our planet and avoid the worst effects of climate change.
Now the Biden-Harris Administration’s Build Back Better Agenda includes an even larger investment that would create new jobs, help cut emissions in half by 2030, invest in coastal and soil conservation, and a lot more.
.@JoeBiden played a major role in getting that passed—and over our eight years in office, carbon emissions decreased by nine percent, while the U.S. economy grew by more than 10 percent.

If you worked as an organizer on the campaign or volunteered in your community, I’d love to hear your stories from that day using #Obama08.
What gave me the confidence to move forward in spite of the odds were the people I met, including those on our campaign. They didn’t do it for me. They did it because they believed in what this country could be, and that we could change it for the better. https://t.co/6AasYvhUZl
It’s hard to believe that 15 years have passed since I stood in front of the Old Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, and announced my candidacy for President. At the time, our campaign was viewed as a longshot—historic perhaps, but unlikely to end in the White House. https://t.co/Y3bC3JDwnt

On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the victims and survivors of one of the darkest periods in our history. But it’s not enough to remember — we also need to have the courage to speak out against acts of bigotry and hatred whenever we see them.
The Biden Administration has set up a way for folks to get four at-home COVID tests for free. Go to https://t.co/ELjD6AatMb to order, or call their hotline at 1-800-232-0233. And if you need to get vaccinated or boosted, visit https://t.co/k4jKpPT5qo today.
The road ahead will not be easy, especially when one of our two major parties is standing in the way. But I still believe we can create a brighter future together, and I look forward to watching the Biden Administration build on this progress. https://t.co/z2j8jFokcq
This Administration has also recommitted to the fight against climate change, and signed a crucial infrastructure law to improve roads and buildings across our country. And they're only getting started.
Under his leadership, our economy set the record for the most jobs added in a single year. Over 200 million people are now vaccinated against COVID-19. The American Rescue Plan provided relief to families. More people can now afford healthcare.
For eight years, I witnessed firsthand the empathy and precision @POTUS brought to our work repairing the American economy. And one year into his presidency, President Biden's administration has led a historic recovery effort.
In his inaugural address one year ago today, @POTUS committed to “press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.” In the year since, he and the @VP have made significant progress in the face of enormous challenges. https://t.co/5YFbMnw3Pg

We've seen how the Affordable Care Act continues to help folks—especially in states that didn't expand Medicaid—get the peace of mind they need. But we still have more work to do to expand access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/wOFof5iBMR

The House just passed the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. Now the Senate needs to do the same. It's the best way to protect the right to vote, end partisan gerrymandering, and restore crucial parts of the Voting Rights Act.
That’s why I fully support @POTUS’s call to modify Senate rules as necessary to make sure pending voting rights legislation gets called for a vote. And every American who cares about the survival of our most cherished institutions should support the President’s call as well.
The filibuster has no basis in the Constitution, and in recent years, it has become a routine way for the Senate minority to block important progress on issues supported by the majority of voters. But we can’t allow it to be used to block efforts to protect our democracy.
Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to do the right thing and call a vote on crucial voting rights legislation. Future generations are counting on us to protect our democracy. I wrote out some thoughts about why this is so important. https://t.co/hjab4Ejxox
I wanted to share some of those stories, and also hear about the work you’ve been doing to create change: https://t.co/KhjWS3bFGo

If you care about climate change, @JohnDoerr's new book, Speed &amp; Scale: An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now, offers concrete steps that we can all take to make a difference. https://t.co/jYmFBaDDIx
That’s why, if we’re going to act on the scale that’s required, climate change can’t be seen as another opportunity to score political points. We need everybody. And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference.
But once again, progress is partial. Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be, and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized.
The good news is that countries around the world recognize this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster, and are setting important goals for 2030. They’ve also promised to help countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change.
I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about what’s happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement, and how much further we still need to go to control climate change. https://t.co/an9xxwrOQC

At a time when voting rights are being rolled back, the Freedom to Vote Act would strengthen our democracy and give more Americans a voice. That’s why the Senate should do the right thing and protect what so many generations fought so hard to secure.
It was great speaking with the @MBK_Alliance Advisory Council, and hearing more about the work they’re doing to make a difference in the lives of boys and young men of color across the country. https://t.co/b4bpZZXP11
General Colin Powell understood what was best in this country, and tried to bring his own life, career, and public statements in line with that ideal. Michelle and I will always look to him as an example of what America—and Americans—can and should be. https://t.co/vSxTbUE5aR
Congrats to our new WNBA champs, @ChicagoSky! I couldn’t be prouder of this team — they worked hard for this moment, and have made our city proud. https://t.co/Da9cLtvSX4
Today, we lost an icon with the passing of Timuel Black. Over his 102 years, Tim was many things: a veteran, historian, author, educator, civil rights leader, and humanitarian. Michelle and I send our thoughts to his family, and everyone who loved him. https://t.co/EDxgIGbZHB
I was deeply saddened to learn about the passing of General Ray Odierno after a battle with cancer. He devoted his life to serving this country, and for that I will always be grateful. Michelle and I send our thoughts to his wife Linda, and their children. https://t.co/25EWqyAXdI
Congratulations to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov. This award is a tribute to their extraordinary courage and the enduring value of fact-based journalism and freedom of expression, which is under threat in far too many places today. https://t.co/bEcbuOZ5pn
And of course, I’m excited for my @WhiteSox to be back in the playoffs. It’s going to be hard to top a walk-off home run on the Field of Dreams, but if any team can do it, it’s this one. Go Sox! https://t.co/vymsDfGpCW

If we don’t stand up for democracy, we’ll see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states. It’s why @DemRedistrict is fighting for #FairMaps. And it’s why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering.
And in Georgia, Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color – including African Americans in a historically Black district – and ignores how the state has changed.
In Texas, for example, Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder, especially for people of color. Now they’re advancing a new congressional map that’s tilted in their favor and doesn’t reflect the state’s growth. https://t.co/VRvoLXZsPq
Right now, state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts. And in many states, Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power.
Our latest production from Higher Ground, Ada Twist, Scientist, is now on Netflix. Based on the book series, the show will continue the work we started at the White House Science Fair.

The Freedom to Vote Act just introduced in the Senate would strengthen our democracy by making it easier for people to vote and harder for politicians and special interests to drown out the voices of ordinary Americans. I support it, and every Senator should do the same.

California! You’ve got a big choice to make by September 14, and everything is on the line. Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids or putting them at risk; helping Californians recover or taking us backwards. Vote “no” on the Republican recall.

Our hearts go out to the families who lost a loved one, and to everyone continuing the mission in Kabul. We’re also thinking of the families of the Afghans who died, many of whom stood by America and were willing to risk everything for a chance at a better life.
As president, nothing was more painful than grieving with the loved ones of Americans who gave their lives serving our country. As President Biden said, these service members are heroes who have been engaged in a dangerous, selfless mission to save the lives of others.
Like so many of you, Michelle and I were heartbroken to hear about the terrorist attack outside the Kabul airport that killed and wounded so many U.S. service members, as well as Afghan men, women, and children.
Yesterday, the House passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that will help Americans everywhere make their voices heard. Now the Senate needs to follow the House’s lead. Call your Senators and ask them to do the right thing. Our democracy is on the line. https://t.co/QeADGFObbx

Congress needs to summon the same courage we saw a half century ago when the Voting Rights Act was passed and guarantee every American a voice and a vote.
The Voting Rights Act, signed into law 56 years ago today, was a monumental piece of legislation. But with the Supreme Court and state legislatures making it harder to cast a ballot, we can’t take voting rights for granted.
From the coal mines of Pennsylvania to the halls of Congress, Rich Trumka was a fierce advocate for working Americans. He loved this country, and he never missed an opportunity to remind us what we can be. Thinking of his family, friends, and federation on this difficult day.

The principle of universal coverage has been established, and 31 million people now have access to care through the law we passed—with millions more who can no longer be denied coverage or charged more because of a preexisting condition.
Today, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. Again. This ruling reaffirms what we have long known to be true: the Affordable Care Act is here to stay.
On the ninth anniversary of DACA, I’m thinking about all the brave DREAMers who have stepped forward to tell their stories. They have fueled a movement that is still working to guarantee the permanent protections they deserve. I will always be inspired by their fight. https://t.co/YrVuuVTrrE

Now we need to keep it up. Because until every single American has access to quality, affordable health care, we have more work to do—and I’m grateful to President Biden for continuing to lead the fight.
The American Rescue Plan lowers premiums for millions of families, makes health insurance more affordable for low-and middle-income Americans, and provides incentives for states to expand Medicaid and cover as many as four million additional Americans.
And now, thanks to the hard work of President Biden, Senator Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Americans all across the country who have spent years fighting against repeal and pushing to improve the law, our starter home is starting to look pretty spacious.
The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans get coverage—and up to 130 million Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It has been a lifeline for Americans who've lost their jobs and their health insurance during the pandemic.
As part of the American Rescue Plan, @POTUS just signed the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. It’s an example of how government is supposed to work, and exactly what I hoped would happen when I signed the ACA into law 11 years ago today. https://t.co/G7WUgYdxOp
A once-in-a-century pandemic cannot be the only thing that slows mass shootings in this country. It’s time for leaders everywhere to listen to the American people when they say enough is enough. https://t.co/7MEJ87Is3E
Join me, @ProtectOurCare, and health care advocates from across the country to discuss 11 years of the Affordable Care Act and the work we still need to do to make sure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. Watch now: https://t.co/Rae2yr8EjZ
Bruce @Springsteen and I both had complicated relationships with our fathers. In our latest conversation on Renegades: Born in the USA, we discuss our upbringing, masculinity, and the role our fathers played in helping us become the men we are today. https://t.co/FNriJIUw3r https://t.co/tqGXS6SzMj
11 years after the Affordable Care Act was passed, it’s getting even better. I’ll be having a conversation with @ProtectOurCare this Monday, March 22 at 1:15 PM ET and hope you’ll join: https://t.co/SpbyOP81Ky
.@POTUS set a goal to deliver 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days. His administration hit the milestone in just 58. Let’s keep it going: Please get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It’s the only way to beat this pandemic. https://t.co/uYmwRMMmYw
Like many of you, I’m thrilled that #MarchMadness is finally back. You can check out my picks here: https://t.co/S5mlQofvAp https://t.co/xyePa9ux2y
Michelle and I pray for the victims, their families, everyone grieving these needless and devastating killings—and we urge meaningful action that will save lives.
Yesterday's shootings are another tragic reminder that we have far more work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the pervasive patterns of hatred and violence in our society.
Congrats to directors @NicoleNewnham, @JimLeBrecht, and everyone with @CripCampFilm on the Oscar nomination! The heart, passion, and brilliance of those who led the disability rights movement is something to celebrate. Michelle and I hope you'll watch their story on Netflix.
I could not be prouder of the @ChiPubSchools students I spoke with recently about A Promised Land. One of the reasons I wrote this book was for young people to be able to see themselves in my story—and I hope our conversation left them as inspired as it left me. https://t.co/Aov53IvX6l
For the latest episode of our podcast, I talk to Bruce @Springsteen about my time as a community organizer and the influences that led to me pursuing a career in public service. Take a listen on Spotify: https://t.co/pxARdCUpFO https://t.co/l67AZEFuC5
"When @POTUS was elected, he said help was on the way—and he delivered. The American Rescue Plan is landmark legislation that will ring through generations, lifting up families and beating back this pandemic. 
 
Here's how it will help people like you: https://t.co/EabnMBoXhy"
Michelle and I got vaccinated against COVID-19 because we know it’s the best way to beat this pandemic, protect one another, and get the country back up and running again. So I hope you’ll get the vaccine as soon as it’s available to you. It could save your life. https://t.co/OJLwZbv0iz
From my first cross-country road trip as a child to Bruce’s experience coming of age toward the end of the Vietnam War, @Springsteen and I each continue to reflect on moments from our upbringing that helped shape our view of America. Listen here: https://t.co/3vQxU2zQub https://t.co/BPwubQuBcv
Fifty-six years after Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet over. There are more steps to be taken, more bridges to be crossed. And that’s why the Obama Presidential Center is designed to honor the giants who carried us and inspire the next generation to lead us forward. https://t.co/0ac3aWgCY0
This is the kind of progress that’s possible when we elect leaders across government who are devoted to making people’s lives better—and a reminder of why it’s so important to vote.
This landmark legislation will help families pay rent and put food on the table, lift millions of children out of poverty, make health care more affordable, aid small businesses, fund broad-based vaccination efforts, and make it easier for states to reopen schools.
Elections matter—and we’re seeing why. Congratulations to the Biden Administration and to the American people on a COVID relief bill that will improve the lives of families across the country.
.@BillGates' new book is an exceptionally clear and accessible primer on climate change. He's unblinking in the difficulty of meeting this challenge but maintains a cautious optimism that it can be met—and provides a framework for action that is both specific and workable. https://t.co/Ukms2M9iK5
And as we rightly celebrate what Democrats accomplished in the 2020 election, it’s always worth analyzing those successes in depth—and looking at where we came up short—as we look toward future cycles. This interview includes some ideas worth considering: https://t.co/c75VpLwkgD
The Biden administration’s commitment to democratic values at home and abroad couldn’t be more important—because democracy remains at risk around the world: https://t.co/hjDcY6ZtOv
If you haven’t read Michelle’s memoir yet, I hope you do—especially if the young readers’ edition might resonate with you or someone you know. Becoming isn’t just a title—it’s a process we all go through, and Miche’s story brings that to life with real honesty and beauty. https://t.co/bO8Y0Kkelz
Music has always been an important part of my life, and I think it’s safe to say that the same is true for @Springsteen. In this episode, we talked about the songs that’ve made a difference for us—and Bruce even brought out the guitar. Listen on @Spotify: https://t.co/pUlY5kGQnZ https://t.co/vhMRZMgpnE

In each of us, there's a story to be shared—a story that’s sacred and can bring us together. I had such a good time talking with the @WellReadBlkGirl Book Club about A Promised Land because just as they learned about my story, I had a chance to learn from theirs. https://t.co/u6vAXUSK5s
Even as we focus on fighting COVID-19, it’s important to recognize that there’s another pandemic raging right now—one that’s decades in the making and unique to the United States. We need to treat gun violence with the same urgency and resolve. https://t.co/3nD7uc194V
Sending my prayers to @TigerWoods and his family tonight—here’s to a speedy recovery for the GOAT of golf. If we’ve learned anything over the years, it’s to never count Tiger out.
Last year, I sat down with my good friend Bruce @Springsteen for a long and meaningful conversation that touched on so much of what we’re all dealing with these days. I’m excited to share it with you over the next few weeks: https://t.co/sQACD08AWx https://t.co/biMoxCLhAG
For decades, John Lewis not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example. On his birthday, we honor his memory, and work toward continuing his legacy by creating change in our communities.
I want to share this inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. King's imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFK's campaign. It's a story we can all learn from—a story of overlooked heroes and the power each of us has to create change. https://t.co/yIaNJpRq7M
Congrats to @NASAJPL on landing @MarsPersevere today! Looking forward to seeing what this mission uncovers—and proud our administration invested in this effort eight years ago to help continue America’s rich tradition of exploration and discovery.
I felt inspired and hopeful after speaking with students in @TheTellingRoom’s Young Writers &amp; Leaders program. I wrote #APromisedLand in part because I hoped to reach young people like those in this group—the unique voices of a new generation, energized and unafraid to dream big. https://t.co/LP1Ri8Epva

In her extraordinary career, Cicely Tyson was one of the rare award-winning actors whose work on the screen was surpassed only by what she was able to accomplish off of it.

Let’s guarantee that every citizen has equal representation in our government. And end partisan gerrymandering, so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians. And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster—a Jim Crow relic––then that’s what we should do.
We can do this by making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including formerly incarcerated people. Let’s also make sure to add more polling places, expand early voting, and make Election Day a national holiday.
We've got to fight harder to protect the right to vote. It’s one of the most powerful tools we have––and we can start by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Once we pass that, we should continue marching forward to make it even better.
Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act––one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. But once the Supreme Court weakened it, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially in communities of color.
I’m proud to endorse this diverse and hopeful collection of thoughtful, empathetic, and highly qualified Democrats. If you’re in one of their districts or states, make sure you vote for them this fall. And if you can, vote early—by mail or in person. https://t.co/PSm3Rf3wkF https://t.co/7RXrJriBz8

Today I’m tipping my hat to all the giants in the Negro Leagues, from Satchel Paige to Toni Stone and so many others. Their brave example, first set 100 years ago, changed America’s pastime for the better––opening it up for new generations of players and fans alike. https://t.co/05jWocKs17

"Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory, or an acceptance of the way things are. It's a celebration of progress. It's an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible––and there is still so much work to do.

...and now to stand up for those ideals, we have to move forward and elect @JoeBiden and a Democratic Congress that does its job, protects DREAMers, and finally creates a system that’s truly worthy of this nation of immigrants once and for all.
Eight years ago this week, we protected young people who were raised as part of our American family from deportation. Today, I'm happy for them, their families, and all of us. We may look different and come from everywhere, but what makes us American are our shared ideals…

"In Columbia, Maryland, young people wielded social media to connect across boundaries, amplify voices, and enact some real change.  
https://t.co/RWcfVwdv4j"
"This group of Nashville teens led a peaceful march with tens of thousands of people in their community. 
https://t.co/KWVsI0Z53E"
Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen young people in every corner of the country step up and become leaders. Through organization and mobilization, they’re showing us how we can sustain this momentum to bring about real change. https://t.co/UKnowQM2Lj
It’s too early to tell if it’s permanent, but the changes brought on by COVID-19 are forcing many of us to reflect on what really matters in our lives. https://t.co/9qlOdWKAuO
"As has always been true at key moments in history, it’s going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible.

I couldn’t be prouder of all the young people leading that change right now. Here’s my advice for the Class of 2020: https://t.co/XD2n7LEihk"
We’ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice––but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBK_Alliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. https://t.co/PAsWb607EU
Third, every city in this country should be a @MBK_Alliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: https://t.co/RZRwimA3SO
Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: https://t.co/c8pAlhJsPJ
First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: https://t.co/V7b0mJoZiL
Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBK_Alliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now:
In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: https://t.co/50F9ZP3JhQ
"And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.

https://t.co/ftmm5crbgg"
"Here’s a useful read––a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors.

https://t.co/Ondw85gQNL"
"""Let’s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don’t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you’re voting for. And that’s how we're going to hit 'em."" https://t.co/WX6oLNRtI2"
Let’s get to work. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv
I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts.
If you want to take concrete action, but you’re not sure how, we’ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who’ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I
5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away.
4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn’t between protest and politics––we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform.
3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels.
2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices.
1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support.
Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering:
As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, I’ve heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change.
I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv

The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository—and food banks in communities like yours—are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who’ve fallen on hard times.

The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22Ze
In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. https://t.co/JkaBWYejKh
This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they’re helping us build a more equitable future for all. https://t.co/9dsedZYt0E
If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. https://t.co/pnN9KVcvQR

We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall. https://t.co/K8Ucu7iVDK
So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. https://t.co/K8Pvp9Cyaq
We are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started—that journey to justice.
What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, “We ain’t going back. We’ve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.”
Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders.

We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our health professionals and everybody who’ll be on the front lines of this pandemic for a long while. They’re giving everything. May we all model our own behavior on their selflessness and sacrifice as we help each other through this. https://t.co/F3tsJTqd4c
Not everybody can stay home, and we owe a big debt of gratitude to health professionals, transit and airport workers, first responders, and everyone keeping our communities going. Leaders have to step up to support people whose lives and livelihoods take a hit in the weeks ahead.

2019 was full of moments that show humanity at its best—compassionate, entrepreneurial, determined. And yes, hopeful. Take a look to see for yourself. https://t.co/x0ayOMM04s
You can get the zen garden next week, but tomorrow is the last day to sign up for health coverage at https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. This year, most current https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers can find an insurance plan with a monthly premium of $10 or less. Get covered today! https://t.co/tPDDSje2ej
It was remarkable to be back in the Asia-Pacific region with my sister this week, joined by hundreds of talented and optimistic @ObamaFoundation leaders. They’re making their mark on this region—and the whole world—and that's good for all of us. https://t.co/LsBwoZCliF
My sister Maya and I are about to take the stage at @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific. We'll be talking about how growing up in this region made us who we are—and the opportunity today's young people have to shape the future. I hope you'll tune in at https://t.co/RobfhErMs1
I thought it was about time I share my holiday gift list — a few practical items, all $10 or less. The best one? Health care for you or somebody you care about. The deadline to sign up is December 15. Go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod and get covered. https://t.co/FCU2sRJeoq
In Vietnam I had the chance to sit down with some of our @ObamaFoundation leaders and alumni from across the Asia Pacific. From combating climate change in Vietnam to evaluating social impact in Indonesia, they're doing extraordinary work and expanding their impact together. https://t.co/3h2BiVzT2D
Because of Paul Volcker, our financial system is stronger and safer for the American people. I’ll remember Paul for his consummate wisdom, untethered honesty, and a level of dignity that matched his towering stature. I’m proud to have called him not just an adviser, but a friend. https://t.co/m3zFR6Q0UF
Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time — and turkey, and maybe a little football — with the ones we love. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving. https://t.co/GEZSGaNSGe
"Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: ""Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity."" https://t.co/AZC9kpqoqx"
Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv
Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu
Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month. https://t.co/jrure7D6Uv
Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation. https://t.co/JSkUnRtaoD
Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt.
This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country https://t.co/rBAMNk0zvb
No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders. https://t.co/aHHeNvAisn
Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy.
Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics. https://t.co/IljmKBq7Gm
Today’s the first day of open enrollment on https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod, and high-quality coverage might be more affordable than you think. Nearly 9 in 10 https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod customers qualify for financial help—so if you or someone you know needs insurance, #GetCovered today.
Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm
.@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world.
Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV
I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.
In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J
Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar.
Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu
As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why. It’s a tribute to American leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you’ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw
Like the Beatles said: It’s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mImRqIYn1R
On National Voter Registration Day, it’s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX — and tell your friends, too.
One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it.
Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C
That’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2
"Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he’d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.
https://t.co/H6xBIW4Ka0"
Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPH
As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDl
Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs
Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt
"Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it—keep it up, David! That’s some creative organizing.
https://t.co/bbkbf7vygr"
Training is at the heart of organizing. It’s why I’ve always made it a priority – from my 2008 campaign until now. And it’s why I’m proud to announce @allontheline’s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U. Join us: https://t.co/yrWJ50wSdE https://t.co/HiKvGd2XyE
With summer winding down, here’s a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow. Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/BS5ri1lvxz
A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. It can help you find common ground. And it’s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground’s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. https://t.co/KzkYFqjrFV
Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9t
Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xo
https://t.co/nNOVtQ50O4
The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQR
Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: https://t.co/d9zwitUNOa https://t.co/mEbwKCDUiP
Here’s a worthwhile Sunday read: “…nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.” https://t.co/tpdMZ9hJoE
I’ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration. But more than what we did, I’m proud of how they’re continuing to fight for an America that’s better. https://t.co/0cfDltjueP
Economist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we’ve seen in recent decades—but trying to reverse it. Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful: https://t.co/CcsXpVVfkP
Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act—and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: https://t.co/Lj4g7lGFnq
In America, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtG
#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better. https://t.co/fKgrVRiHhc
I have a good feeling about these Chicago @UrbanAlliance interns. Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you—you’re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud. In fact, you already have. https://t.co/ZjzFQmBQqm
The @ObamaFoundation is helping a new generation of leaders make their mark, and there’s an extraordinary group gathering this week for Obama Leaders: Africa. Their work will help unlock the incredible promise of the continent—and make the world better for all of us. https://t.co/rnPHn9UuEn
Proud to rep America’s best team! Congrats @USWNT and thanks for being such a strong inspiration for women and girls—and everybody—all across the country. https://t.co/9Gp6UTZhEE
