If we really can’t call Vlad’s bluff right now with force of arms, let’s at least stand alongside Ukraine by going on offense with extreme prejudice, exposing the American Vichy stooges, freezing RUS out of the society they cynically enjoy &amp; exploit; reduce their world to…

Ha ha! 👇🏼. Hard agree. @GavinNewsom , this decision on solar isn’t a hilariously satirical movie (😎)…it’s the actual future our kids will have to live in. Don’t make CA punch itself in the face and fall through a glass coffee table. It will actually hurt. Trust me! https://t.co/MgcKczXegM
We need to get loud about this. This is truly a moment of truth &amp; choice between an American Renewal, characterized by the technological innovation &amp; entrepreneurial dynamism that made this country a powerhouse or remaining shackled to broken &amp; dirty system
Another good piece https://t.co/9l1bgeqX6n
There is a huge grassroots effort to convince the Governor &amp; the CPUC to scrap this residential solar killer proposal &amp; look for a better way to make changes to the current system that will let rooftop solar continue to grow &amp; protect our environment and climate.
For those interested in a really comprehensive point-by-point takedown of how truly horrendously ill-conceived this CPUC proposal is, see below. https://t.co/5SmNdtQXYg   “I have never seen a Proposed Decision (PD) that is as regressive and out-of-touch with reality as this one”
This &amp; other aspects of the proposal all designed to punish consumers who are realizing it makes terrific economic sense to go solar. all pushed by the utilities to protect their control over CA's energy system--  even while our state is burning &amp; drying out due to climate change
And they are proposing slashing the amount customers will be paid (credited) for any clean power they share back to the grid. They don’t even want to have credit a customer for clean distributed power the homeowner supplies to the grid at the rate they then sell that power for!
They’ve been in Gov @GavinNewsom &amp; regulator ears &amp; now California regulators are proposing to adopt rules that will destroy the rooftop solar market in CA by imposing very high fees on customers who install solar (about $60/month additional flat fee for an average customer).
For example, California utilities like PG&amp;E want to maintain their monopoly &amp;  look for every opportunity to kill rooftop solar which liberates customers from their control. Decentralized matrix of customers producing their own clean energy &amp; saving money hurts their share price
Renewable energy industry is one of highest growth American economic stories. But one of biggest impediments to acceleration of this transformation is the determined resistance of antiquated, sclerotic centralized utilities that don’t want energy independent American consumers
The good news is that within this challenge is one of the biggest economic opportunities in human history: skilled jobs, hugely profitable new industries, massive investor returns alongside reduction of trillions $ dirty energy framework costs us in health &amp; environmental damage.
"it is causing our economy &amp; our very lives. This means we MUST decarbonize our economy &amp; transition to electrification of transportation 
&amp; energy use in homes &amp; offices &amp; data centers etc. To do this at scale we MUST transition to renewable energy"
A thread for those interested in why we should all care about policy that promotes (not discourages) mass adoption of residential solar energy:  1) we’re in a transformational moment for our society. We MUST confront the dire threat of climate change &amp; the disruptions
The proposed revisions to CA solar power regulations by CPUC are an absolute disaster for CA’s jobs, CA’s capacity to meet emission reduction targets, the national solar industry &amp; transformation of America’s energy model. @GavinNewsom you must not let this happen. https://t.co/k636mnbYYZ

If anyone is wondering why I’m writing this:   I co-founded EDO with my friend Dr. Daniel Nadler (founder &amp; ex-CEO of Kensho). Biased? Yup. But we assembled this all-star team &amp; we’re incredibly proud of the brilliant work they’re doing.  @karaswisher @profgalloway @jonahgoodhart
Data based on mid-funnel consumer behaviors *predictive of eventual sales*  brings what digital ad platforms have been able to deliver to the urgently needed evolution of Convergent TV.   If your company’s research budget doesn’t reflect this revolution, you’re behind the curve.
And we’ll throw down &amp; say that efficacy analysis rooted in real time Search Engagement Rate is the new gold standard metric for cost/performance analysis.  Bullshit social sentiment or weak sauce multi-touch attribution signal, sorry…no.  Debate us on this, we welcome it.
Convergent TV advertising supports a $100B creative industry &amp; underwrites the work of some of our most brilliant creators &amp; storytellers  Counting how many people (probably) sat in front of a screen when an ad ran is entirely insufficient as a pricing metric &amp; has been for years
Great data engineering &amp; world-class data science allow EDO to handle enormous, unruly data sets with statistical rigor in near real-time &amp; produce finance-grade actionable analytics in cloud-based software, reports, and APIs. That's a modern tech platform.
Nielsen has about 46,000 employees but it seems they can’t collect &amp; sort data from 100k set-top boxes w reliable speed.  You pay for that headcount, not speed or quality of insight We’re glad someone still does exposure but who on earth would price ad inventory off that in 2021?
EDO achieves this w/ just over 50 brilliant people on our team. We process 1TB of video &amp; 3.6B fingerprint hashes per hour, storing it all in the cloud. We know how to automate. We have some of the legit top ML / AI DS &amp; Eng pros in the world. That drives powerful efficiency
By 3am, EDO wraps its everyday routine, processing 1+ Petabyte of data covering anonymous, aggregated behavior of over 90% of the US pop. Producing investment grade insight on which ads most effectively drove actions tightly correlated w/ purchase intent &amp; actual economic outcome
Meanwhile, it took EDO a few hours after the game to complete its full SB report. During it we collected, processed &amp; analyzed anonymized minute-by-minute searches of 100's of millions of people to assess effectiveness of every ad airing in &amp; around the SB, virtually in real time
It took around 36h for Nielsen to process data it collects from only 100K households. A pretty rudimentary system to then make a high-school math level extrapolation against US pop of 320million toward the stunning insight: How many people probably watched (big yawn)
Epic fail. But if you're an https://t.co/UO4dbxZCWE client, you don’t really care bc you had a much higher-value ad effectiveness report on this critical ad event by 3am, ready to discuss Monday morning (public version 👇, clients get much richer data)    https://t.co/0HT0rRrEDU
To any companies who spent a bunch of $ on Super Bowl ads only to wake up &amp; read (below) that Nielsen couldn’t deliver a low-tech ratings report for over 24 hours: if you’re crazy enough to still be relying on Nielsen for insights, you’re shit out of luck  https://t.co/T4HCPPwruN

@sacca I think it’s that Bannon 1) is setting up financing for Trump Mob from his Chinese pal whose yacht he hangs out on  2) knows way too much about everything else related to 2016 campaign to risk leaving him twisting in the wind, looking for a way to reduce his sentence.
Actors &amp; stunt professionals at every level of the trade:  this is worth watching 100’s of times (as I have just done) to study the precise physical dynamics &amp; choreography of movement / eye-line at play here that lead to SUCH a satisfying punch line. VERY hard to replicate. https://t.co/qaLALS19Zt
@glennkirschner2 Glen, in the cases of Bannon &amp; especially Stone, Flynn, Manafort etc, if the pardons are issued in furtherance of covering up the President’s own crime, can they not be challenged and voided?  Along with self-pardon one would think that a pardon of a co-conspirator is illegal

of pernicious, unblunted, systemic, murderous racism that our friends, colleagues &amp; fellow Americans live under.   Any of us who thinks we do ‘enough’, read that letter from a jail in Birmingham and reassess based on MLK’s criteria.
The last 4 years, &amp; especially the last week, should have brought white America fully up &amp; out of the self-satisfying dream that we have participated fully &amp; sufficiently in creating equality in this country &amp; awoken everyone of conscience to the painful enduring reality
Because it’s devastating that it’s STILL as directly applicable &amp; descriptive of social conditions for African Americans TODAY!  It should be a part of the historical record that we look back on &amp; mark as the clarion call that helped END racial injustice, bigotry, white supremacy
I just re-read ‘Letter from a Birmingham Jail’.  Full text here https://t.co/5nD2anNbG9  There are too many great lines in this brilliant, forceful, compassionate but fierce piece of writing to quote. I think all white Americans of good conscience should read it today.
Today’s meditation: MLK Day isn’t like Labor Day, it’s not a holiday from work. It’s the opposite. It’s a day dedicated TO work. To continue his work. To read his exhortations &amp; recommit to dedicating our personal time, resources &amp; courage to advance his cause in his absence.

Faith in the strength of our sacred institutions &amp; founding principles is severely stretched...but they will hold. They will. He’s leaving, gracelessly &amp; in infamy. But if we trade for it, give him some brokered settlement, we’ll be vulnerable to his return. We can’t flinch.
But his contemptible, treasonous, seditious assault on the stability of our political compact isn’t about 2024, personal enrichment or anything else other than trying to use chaos &amp; threat to the foundation of the system as leverage to trade for a safe exit. Call. His. Bluff.
I will allow that he’s also a whiny, sulky, petulant, Grinchy, vindictive little 10-ply-super-soft bitch who no doubt is just throwing a wicked pout fest &amp; trying to give a tiny-hand middle finger to the whole country for pure spite, without a single thought for the dead &amp; dying
His ‘turn card’ bluff will be an escalation &amp; his ‘River card’ bluff could be really ugly. But they have to be called. We cannot let this mobster bully the USA into a deal to save his ass by threatening our democracy. THAT is his play. But he’s got junk in his hand. So call him.
...which is to create enough chaos &amp; anxiety about peaceful transfer of power, &amp; fear of irreparable damage to the system, that he can cut a Nixon-style deal in exchange for finally conceding. But he doesn’t have the cards. His bluff after ‘the flop’ has been called in court...
...or that ‘chaos is what he loves’. The core of it is that he knows he’s in deep, multi-dimensional legal jeopardy &amp; this defines his every action. We’re seeing 1) a tactical delay of the transition to buy time for coverup &amp; evidence suppression 2) above all, a desperate endgame
I’m no political pundit but I grew up w a dad who was a federal prosecutor &amp; he taught me a lot &amp; I’ve also sat a fair amount of poker w serious players &amp; l’ll say this: I do not think Trump is trying to ‘make his base happy’ or ‘laying the groundwork for his own network’...
This is way beyond ‘trampling on norms’. We seem to be steadily losing any determination to enforce moral or legal hazard. If people flout laws with impunity, what’s to create any sense of risk deterrence &amp; how long until we just can’t maintain rule of law?
Joking aside, could some constitutional &amp; criminal law experts weigh in on whether actively, in the public forum, inciting illegal actions to upend the results of lawful elections meets criminal standards of sedition or insurrection laws? @neal_katyal @PreetBharara @tribelaw ? https://t.co/Z1CukvpA28

@DonaldJTrumpJr In case these things are hard for you to understand:  1) your father motivated unprecedented numbers of people to vote because he has attacked the very fabric of our democracy and social unity  2) most Americans live in cities dumbass
@SteveSchmidtSES @IvankaTrump You’re forgetting Lap Dance Barbie (seated father sold separately), Baku Barbie (Iranian Revolutionary Guard partner sold separately), Family Values Barbie (Children in cages sold separately) and Rejected Crying Barbie (scowling Anna Wintour doll w back turned sold separately)
One negative trade off against my profound joy in Trump’s defeat is that now I’ve lost my excuse to move to Canada so I could watch all of @LetterkennyProb without commercial interruptions. But we have to make sacrifices to fight for our ideals. 😎
Correct. Commit their names to memory and make sure they join Trump in infamy and hold them to account. https://t.co/YGCIRSoBTz

It would be nice to have confidence in the below except that I think it is a misread on his goals.

Imagine if you’re in the US armed forces, risking your life overseas or the Peace Corps serving our country abroad &amp; you vote absentee in Michigan &amp; you have to listen to people demanding your vote not be counted.

If the legal, mailed-on-time mail ballots held up in USPS sites and XPO trucks by DeJoy were ordered found, delivered &amp; counted, Biden would also win at least one of PA / GA / NC, larger margins in MI, WI, AZ, NV and FL would be worth revisiting https://t.co/bqXqoHZqAL
More detail on this issue.  Look at where delivery rates are especially low &amp; what the effect would be of 300,000 votes spread across these states, given their margins.  There’s vote suppression but this is outright vote cancellation. Theft. Who’s got legal standing to litigate? https://t.co/fvbfziYaKf
It would seem to me this could significantly affect final totals in WI / MI / PA / GA / FL / AZ / TX / NC

Perfectly maps &amp; articulates the degree to which @GOP is a group of intellectual charlatans, espousing a faux mantra of ‘conservatism’ that is in fact a veneer for pure plutocratic, white, male protectionism resistant to every achievement of social progress in the last 100 years
“from Reconstruction to the New Deal to the civil rights revolution, conservatives have long felt genuinely victimized by the prospect of equality. That doesn’t mean, however, that bad-faith right-wing arguments about the courts merit a respectful hearing.” 💯% dead on... 1) https://t.co/GZ8iTCgvBg
It only offends them until they need it. In truth it never actually offends them.

6)...are fools. He can’t relate to anyone who isn’t acting transactionally to further their own interest. He’s a pure grifter, in thrall to (and unquestionably in actual debt to) the enemies of our country working actively at this moment to undermine our elections.
5) Trump demonstrably can’t comprehend service. Maybe this is why he won’t respond to Russian bounties placed on our troops (on top of the various forms of leverage Putin clearly has on him)..he really does think people who choose to serve &amp; risk their life for their country..
4) ...20 year career as Army aviator flying Apaches &amp; Blackhawks, then serving as officer in SoComm Italy, &amp; like his dad, raising a wonderful family during his service.  Donald Trump &amp; his enablers don’t belong in the same room w people like them.
3) My beloved grandfather, James W Rouse, left home &amp; new daughter (my mom) to serve as Lt Cmndr in Navy Air Force in Pacific Fleet, WW2. 1942-1945.  My wonderful uncle, Tom Hutt US Navy Ret, full career officer in nuclear class submarines. His son, my dear cousin, Thomas Hutt..
2) My dad joined the Marines out of conviction that ‘ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country’ had real meaning. He was at Con Thien through the summer of ‘67. Ignorant Cadet Bone Spurs has zero clue what that means but Marines surely do.

a big joke &amp; we’re supposed to admire their business savvy.  Fuck that.  You paved the way for fascism to take root in the United States of America. That’s your legacy.  Live with it.  @ProjectLincoln  @SteveSchmidtSES , other former GOP faithfuls who are working with real focus
of that whole enterprise, work to actually dismantle it by revealing the deep truth of it...then let’s talk. @JuddApatow has been banging this drum loudly &amp; it’s time more in our industry followed suit &amp; called it out because they show up at our parties &amp; act like it’s all...

and lied through his teeth about the whole affair.  Now he wants an exit ramp back into grace &amp; resigning from the most damaging propaganda machine ever deployed against human interest and wearing some open collar plaid shirts &amp; pretending to care about the environment...
totally they are being screwed and laughed at by the plutocracy that Fox was really built to defend the interests of. And James Murdoch was head of the News of the World when they illegally hacked a dead girl’s phone (along with many others) and he sat in front of Parliament...
Yeah but you know what?... Way too tepid &amp; decades too late.

But how can we get people to pull together to stop brutalizing the Environment of our planet if we can't even stop brutalizing each other?  Right now, this must be the cause of the moment for America because we cannot unite to meet our many other challenges until we truly love,
A global environmental threat looms over all of us.  We are brutalizing the ecosystems that support our way of life &amp; our economies; annihilating the innumerable species that live on the planet with us.  This crisis isn't taking a pause &amp; we must pull together to meet it.
Constitutional right to legal protest &amp; free expression, being beaten, pepper sprayed, run over by SUV's, tear-gassed (journalists as well) to realize that we are at real risk of authoritarian thugs destroying our great democratic experiment.  The enemy is truly among us.
diminishes us all. It shouldn't take witnessing the grotesque &amp; appalling murders of unarmed black men jogging, reaching for their wallets, selling cigarettes; black women sleeping in their beds... to become enraged enough to act, to protest. Nor seeing Americans, exercising the
how shockingly prevalent it is, how violently it expresses itself, how much damage it does to our friends, our brothers &amp; sisters our countrymen &amp; women who experience it; how it woven into our social structure &amp; economy, both by intention &amp; by default. It shames us all
and I'll share some posts on that following this.  But it would be emotionally dishonest &amp; difficult it is right now to detach from full engagement with the emotional, political, social urgency of the confrontation our country is having with the deep, ugly truth of racism..

The memory of who, or what, won awards fades in 24 hours and often can’t be recalled at all within a week.  Being a part of great work, great collaboration, is the highest privilege &amp; is what actually confers the real reward: the elevated opportunity to work again.

To my mind, there is not a single challenge facing humanity more urgent than the challenge of altering our own unsustainable behavior as a species.  Not one. This is our defining, generational cause.  Let's vote only for leaders who commit to this agenda on a policy level...
The ecosystems that support us are in dire crisis and the magical diversity of life, within which we only dimly grasp our dependency, is being decimated.

@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC the bill you're considering to block @Uber_NYC is backed by taxi fleet owners not drivers or residents. NY knows it
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC find one single @Uber_NYC driver who would go back to driving taxi You can't. You're defending taxi fleet slumlords
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC no New Yorker prefers taxi model 2 @Uber_NYC but you move to constrict positive change bc taxi fleets give $$ SHAME
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC 4 out 5 cab rides I'm in the driver is on phone, speeding &amp; rude if you ask them to stop. We all know this.
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC taxi fleet owners inflict crappy economics for drivers who then inflict horrible service &amp; poor safety on riders
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC you're fighting for an industry that creates abusive indentured servitude for its drivers, gives them no equity
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC no NY Taxi offers a car pool option to reduce traffic. no NY Taxi offers recourse when a driver is on their phone
@NYCCouncil @deBlasioNYC who would defend utterly horrendous service &amp; moribund biz model of NY Taxis against good service &amp; efficiency?
@NYCCouncil is considering a bill that threatens to destroy 10,000 NYC job opportunities. @deBlasioNYC, oppose ban on new @Uber_NYC cars
